Three,"I think that Middle Eastern Bakery is just OK. I tend to judge a middle eastern place by their gyro platter. I am immediately skeptical if the gyro meat is not carved off a vertical roaster (I am sure there is a more proper name for that thing) and instead looks like it came out of some sort of preformed mold. \n\nUnfortunately at this place, it does not appear carved. The gyro is all the same size and each piece looks exactly the same. It tastes fine, but nothing that blew my mind. \n\nThe hummus here is pretty good, and I do enjoy the Greek salad. \n\nSolid execution. Nice staff, casual atmosphere. You won't be blown away, but you won't be disappointed either."
Four,"""We have some new friends who have never ridden the light rail.  The 4 of us decided to take a trip downtown and pick a restaurant that was an easy walk and one the we could enjoy for less than $50 a couple with a few drinks.\n\nAfter doing the required internet searches we ended up at Hula's Modern Tiki on a Friday night in July.  We arrived around 6:30 and wanted to eat inside (they have a cute outdoor patio) as it was still a hot.  We were the first ones on the waiting list and created a seat at the bar.  Cute place filled with Hawaii type memorabilia.  My wife's Mai Tai was very good which can be a challenge to find in Phoenix.\n\nWe were seat in about 15 minutes.  The wait staff was adequate.  The spicy edamami was actually spicy and I ended up eating most of it.  We ordered the Ahi Taco's and the Carne Asada Taco's.  Each were two large taco's stuff with Ahi tuna and steak cooked to order.  There was enough for 3 or 4 taco's each.  Delicious.  My wife enjoyed the black bean and rice combination and she doesn't do beans.  \n\nThe concrete floors make the atmosphere a little noisy but not obnoxiously so.  The 4 us were able to carry on a \real conversation\"""".  I also notice a manager type \""""floating around\"""" obviously paying attention to the details.  It showed.  I later introduced myself to the manager (Dana) who turned out to be the owner.  I always enjoy a restaurant where the owner/manager is actively involved.\n\nThe price came in right at $40  and we all agreed we would go back again.  It would be a really fun place on the patio when the weather cools."""""""
Three,"Never been a huge fan of this format for Chinese food, but when you're dying of hunger and have limited options, it does hit the spot. Went here because it was walking distance of the Comfort Suites on Roosevelt Street. Seems like most businesses that serve food near the hotel close fairly early, but Panda Express was open until 10:00 p.m.\n\nI did the three entree platter which comes with choice of steamed rice, fried rice, or chow mein. They don't have the old standard General Tso's Chicken (or maybe old General Tso has since retired from the chicken business), but they did have a reasonable facsimile--the Sweetfire Chicken. I also asked for the String Bean Chicken, which had an aromatic component that was delicious, but that I couldn't quite place... cilantro? And finally, for my third entree I chose the Honey Walnut Shrimp. Panda Express's interpretation of these shrimp differs from the traditional Chinese restaurant (no mayonnaise sauce and hardly any candied walnuts), but the honey and the shrimp flavor comes through, so I guess they get a pass.\n\nThis restaurant was an oasis in a desert of food choices and saved us from almost certain hunger-induced lunacy."
Two,"Eating Review of Rokerij\n\nI want to like this place. Its a great setup and well done environment. The setting is stylish and dark so you want to sink into a booth and get down to eating some food.\n\nUnfortunately my first experience has left an impression that is less than stellar. My girlfriend and I had been wanting to try it out a few times. We got a booth by the fireplace and settled in for a nice meal.\n\nThe specials are written up in chalk on the wall as you walk in which is a great method for displaying specials. We are both vegetarians that will eat fish and were excited by the plethora of fish dish choices on the specials board. This tends to say that a place can do fish.\n\nOur server was nice enough but when we asked for some recommendations he stared at us blankly and grabbed the menu like he hadnt eaten there in a while. This is a huge pet peeve for me. If a place is gonna charge $20 or more for an entree the staff better be trained on the dishes and be ready to give some recommendations. Show some passion and knowledge and sell me the good stuff.\n\nWe ordered the White Bean Bruschetta to start. It was edible but lacking in flavor, maybe some salt wouldnt have hurt, but something more than just beans and toast please.\n\nNext was the soup of the day which had a lot of smoke flavor going on, not impressed.\n\nFinally we went with the sesame crusted fish with a melon salsa. This dish started off a disaster and just got worse. First of all the server brings it over holding it with a towel. As We shift plates around to make room he starts yelping a bit in pain. Not a great sign. Once he gets it set down we move to dig in but my lovely date brushes her arm on the plate and comes away with a pretty solid burn.\n\nThis is just plain stupid. There is no need for a plate to be 200 degrees. Cook the food and then bring it out. Dont cook it at my table on the plate!\n\nUnfortunately the fish was not edible, at all. The melon salsa was horrid. We sent it back and still got charged.\n\nRokerij I want to love you. There are a lot of folks on Yelp that love you but I have to say that for food you have not impressed me."
Two,Not as nice as I was expecting... Hotel was at low occupancy and we got a room overlooking a parking lot.  The waterslide pool during the day was nice and not too crowded.    The rooms are sizable and the beds comfortable.The family pool at night was loud and crowded.  Internet was for one computer only... Nickel and dimed.. Even cost $ for the Gym.  Sad when a family goes to have a well deserved break at a place they imagine to be relaxing and it's just more stressful at the end of the day.
Five,"revisted this place, and honestly... it was exactly what I was looking for.  A place to kick back with some friends and have some sushi instead of deep fried everything from other places.  The sushi was well rolled, the wait staff was friendly, the chefs interact with you and if they don't, it's probably cause they're concentrating on making sushi haha.  I like how people show up at restaurants at 945 when they close at 10 and then B about it... get a life, cause obviously the chefs and their families have one.  And why are you watching monkeys masturbate anyways... sick nasty, get a life.  Eat at Sake Bombers more and maybe the chefs will invite you to chill after work."
One,I don't generally like fast food because it's just gross but I was starving and we had a 3 hour layover.  \n\nMy sub was like eating a brick of salt.  I could only eat half of it and that was really pushing it. \n\nI asked the cashier for a napkin. She pointed to the empty containers and told me they were over there.  After looking and telling her they were empty she sent someone out to refill them.  I waited 10 minutes for a napkin.
Two,"We did enjoy our starting garlic shrimp appetizer and the Spicy Vodka hot condiment was a plus point. But pizza connoisseurs like us have tasted the finest Napoli treats and I'm sad to say that although topping wise Lamp does a truly good job to source excellent product, the one singular ingredient to create remarkable pizza missed the mark and that my friends is the pizza dough itself. \nWhether it likely a poor imported flour ratio or over rested dough, but whatever the case it makes for tough and hard as cardboard texture. Sorry to say we'll likely not return for this reason as well as DC Ranch pricepoints. We'll stick with our other Scottsdale fave for now."
Four,"I had fairly low hopes for Chompie's given the far-from NYC location and its Applebee's-like appearance. However, each trip there has been met with success. I don't eat red meat, so my choices are somewhat limited. Nonetheless, my Turkey Reuben and Chicken Liver sandwiches have been excellent. My friend who has gone there with me has indeed ordered red meat sandwiches and has been satisfied as well. The guys even have Dr. Brown's sodas including the infamous Cel-Ray (tastes like Sprite at first then comes the celery flav).\n\nAlthough the complimentary pickles seem to vary in quality, and the waiters can be slow and sometimes clueless as to the ins and outs of the menu, Chompie's has been a solid addition to my restaurant cycle."
Four,"i used to be obsessed with popular outdoor outfitters (r.i.p). this is the closest thing i've found to a replacement. this store is bigger but more corporate than popular ever was (but still less corporate than cabela's or bass pro shops). and sportsman's warehouse carries fly fishing gear, which popular didn't. \n\nnow back to sportsman's warehouse: i've been a pretty consistent shopper here since opening day. they've got some pretty neat stuff, and a wide selection of items i have a hard time finding in other outdoors stores. prices are generally fair and sometimes lower than other outfitters. i buy fly-tying materials for my fly fishing adventures here and the selection is pretty good. they also sell tons of already-tied flies which are nice if i'm feeling lazy and don't want to tie my own. prices seem really fair. spin fishing, backpacking and camping supplies are abundant as are guns, but i don't do guns so i can't evaluate that part of the store with any integrity. for backpacking and camping, they really have it all. oh! there's a whole cooking section too ... spices, freeze-dried food, camp cookbooks, cooking supplies, etc. and a great selection of all the water-type necessities outdoorsy people need: purifiers, bottles, camelbaks, tablets, etc. i've found that prices are more than fair and the workers on the floor are helpful, knowledgeable and friendly - i wish i could say the same about the staff at the registers. \n\nthe fishing report on the white board is cool and useful. the guys in the fishing department pretty much live to fish and share recent experiences. i don't like the pics on the exit wall from customers. there are, inevitably, pics of kids with their bloodied hunting trophies - it makes me sad - but that's a personal problem.\n\nif you live semi- nearby, keep an eye out for your val-pak coupon mailer ... there are $10 off coupons hiding in that envelope!"
Five,"We had a private dinner in what appears to be a wine refrigerator.  The sommelier popped in from time to time to retrieve a bottle.  He wasn't intrusive and it was actually kind of amusing.  Pashminas and blankets are provided for those who felt chilly.  \n\nExcellent seafood platter as a starter.  I devoured a healthy serving of foie gras and had a fabulous pork chop as my main.  We shared all the sides, gruyere potatoes are outstanding.  I was too full to sample the gorgeous pie but did partake of a light and tasty frozen lemon meringue strawberry dessert.  Oodles of delicious champagne and wine.  I was a bit suspect that I would find truly fine dining outside of major metropolitan cities but am happy to report I was wrong."
Three,"""Was in the mood for a nice, classic dirty martini last night and R.J. (bartender) filled the void perfectly. Served with a skewer of small,  delicious Kalamata olives. This was a pleasant twist to the big, green olives. The martini was clean, smooth and perfectly balanced. Thumbs up R.J.! \n\nOn the other hand, the Vegetarian Falafel burger that I ordered was thumbs...sideways. I've had falafel burgers and traditional fried falafel countless times before so I was stoked to see it on their menu. My experience was a disappointment in flavor and texture. The burger was completely bland and could have used a little extra texture. The burger is touted as Michael Mina's mother's recipe. So I really hate to give it a negative review. Perhaps Chef Mina should step Mom's recipe up a notch! #Just saying. \n\nWhen my server asked how my food was, I let him know that I wasn't a fan. His response was,  \Ok, I'll let the chef know\"""" and sheepishly walked away. Huh!??? That's it? Our server was very pleasant and attentive, but when it came to responding to \""""I don't care for my meal\"""" he could have done better. And frankly, if I wasn't with business associates, I would have sent the burger back. I felt that instead of simply saying \""""I'll let the Chef know\"""" he should have asked if he could bring me something else. I accidentally skipped lunch and starving, so I ate the burger...reluctantly. \n\nI've been to Bourbon a few times but always just sit in the bar which I think has great ambiance. The last time I was there, me and my friend ordered classic cheeseburgers. We asked for them to be cooked medium. We got medium-well. The beef is high quality, so the taste was good and we didn't complain. But still, we ASKED for medium. The red onion rings were delish however. \n\nQuestion is: can I get a consistent meal at Bourbon Steak? Jury is still out."""""""
Four,"So after doing an internship in Downtown Phoenix, I was introduced to Carolina's. I was a little apprehensive at first, but I had heard many rants and raves about this hole and had to try for myself. After my first bite of Carolina's burrito, I was in love. It was awesome, and I continued to sample many of the items on Carolina's menu for the remainder of my internship, never once disappointed. I even brought home some of their famed tortillas - just those warmed with a little butter - simply melts in your mouth goodness. Awesome and cheap too!"
Four,"Overall, I like going here. I go mainly for the weight equipment, but I also use their cardio equipment and the group room to warm up/stretch or do some non-group cardio. This facility is clean; the staff is friendly; and there's a lot of equipment. \n\nMonday and Tuesday evenings around 5:30 through 7:00 might be a little busy, but I don't find it too busy that it's impossible to get a good workout in. The a/c works just fine at this facility. I thought I'd mention that as I use to go to the 24 at Camelback and 32nd St and their facility was just incredibly warm during the summer months. I might point out there may have been an occasion here and there that it felt warm, but not often."
Four,"""every time i come to phoenix a pattern develops. i get off the plane. breathe in the warm air, think to myself, i could live here. then the mother tells me about some \fabulous\"""" place (usually part of some fox or lettuce entertain you entity or some other yuppie/old people chain) that we HAVE to go to. we go, wherever she takes me, we are surrounded by douchwits and faketitterellas talk about how great sarah palin is or just how great they are. i get impatient and irritable and swear i will never ever live here.\n\nit didn't happen at bloom.  i did throw up in my mouth a bit as we walked by culinary dropout at the douchery on the patio, but bloom had a great fucking happy hour. pastrami sandwich was huge, as you get fries and a pickle for about 6 bucks, i got me a little wine trifecta, the calamari were tasty as, and the basic salad was on par. we did hear some asshole old people being dicks to the waitress about the size of their happy hour martini glasses, but it was shortlived. \n\nthe quality and portion of the food for the  happy hour prices were impressive compared to other happy hours that try to do the same.  i would go outside and get a table at the end. as tasty and affordable as it was, im much more excited to embark upon a dive bar tour of the city..."""""""
Four,"After a long wait... I had the best stuffed pizza of my life. We waited about 45 minutes to get seated :-(....then the stuffed pizza takes 45 min. I didn't mind waiting for the pizza we knew it was gonna take that long. Absolutely the best stuffed pizza I have ever had, and I was told to try the cookie dessert. It is probably the best dessert I've ever had!!! No joke if you like cookie dough you would love it!! I will go there every time I come back to Az."

Five,"""Growing up in Phoenix this was THE place to go to get wings! Before their redecorating back in 09' it was very \cozy\"""" and very \""""loud\"""" (I'm saddened to see it \""""toned down\"""" after the redecoration) on the outside.\n\nThis is THE place to go for a great deal on wings. 12 for $5? 50 for $24? Hell yeah man! They deep-fry them perfectly - they're still juicy in the middle; the mild, medium, hot, suicide, teriyaki, bbq, honey hot, is really delicious. My family and I love mixing up the teriyaki and medium sauce to give it a great sweet/hot/tangy flavor.\n\nWhen I moved to Tempe, I missed the place; and the other ones - Mill (even though they closed, I still tried them)? Scottsdale? Mesa? Uh, no. Nowhere NEAR as fantastic as compared to the first and original Long Wongs in Phoenix, AZ. I've even ate at the Long Wongs Bars and Grills - the prices were too much for me, 6 for $5? No thanks. I love it as they also take your food to your seats, but always remember to clean up after yourselves! The trash can is the huge Hippo statue by the door ;) The staff and owners are really awesome and sweet, I love playing Pinball and the old retro 80's arcade games while waiting for my food.\n\nThe second best Long Wongs I would have to give props to is the one on Indian School Rd - we found this other gem while the original Long Wongs was still remodeling (and they had given a list of other locations)."""""""
One,"""Location is the ONLY reason I go to this gym and I've been going to this location and others for the past five years.  This past fall, I had gone to the gym after a few months hiatus.  I was on the treadmill for 30 minutes then went back to my locker.  It was broken into.  My purse and phone were taken but not my car keys or Smart Water.  I guess the robber must have seen what I drove (hint: it's probably an inside job )  There were only 2 staff members on site, both young men-no women on staff (hint: hint: it's probably an inside job then) A police officer did come and I reported the robbery which was the 3rd in two weeks!  The next day, I spoke with the manager.  The same speech he's probably have told others, you can tell the bottom line is the only thing he cares about.  I lost everything plus a $100 bill which was my b-day money and I've spent over a few grand for membership.  I did receive a refund for 3 months but still REALLY!  'Well you shouldn't leave stuff in the locker.  These people go to gym to gym.  We have signs that tell you not to leave items in the lockers\...ummm it was locked and I've been going here for over four years and have never had an issue until now. If you are having robberies, you NEED to tell people not just a sign!  Plus one of the staff told me they were having major issues this past fall...umm that's not someone from the outside that's a staff member doing the robberies!  I found out last week there were MORE robberies!  So if you are looking for a gym, move on and go somewhere else.  It's not the cleanest gym but I like the sauna and that's about it! And then I get a call that they found my purse and calendar in a locker.  The manager never followed up with me and when I got my items they were sfuffed in a drawer and the staff member didn't even seem to care.  I think it's time for a new staff and management!"""""""
Five,"The Blue Fin is my favorite Teriyaki stop in the valley.  \n\nTo begin, the service here is awesome!  For such a casual restaurant, they really know how to make you feel welcome.\n\nI absolutely love the food here too.  Great appetizers, spring rolls, inari, sunomono, etc.  Being vegetarian, I always order the same...Steamed Vegetable Bowl.  For the money, you get a TON of food here.  The teriyaki sauce is perfect, not too sweet like some of those chain places.\n\nDid I mention that the service here is the best?\n\nThe only thing wrong with The Blue FIn; they are not opened on the weekends, Monday through Friday only."
Three,"i would've given this review a def. 2**\nbased upon their bloated prices\nand throw away garments\nif not soley for the cute girls that work here, most of whom are super friendly.\n1* for their revolving sale rack\n1* for their huge ass selection\n1* for the cute hipster girls who work here\n(IMPO however, if you're going to pay that much for clothes made by tiny children in sweat shops, why not just cross the street and buy some good quality clothes made by american workers paid at an honest wage fr AA? worth considering)"
Three,"Not sure why this place gets such strong reviews- things were just okay. Bread was mediocre, as other reviewers have said, pesto was tasty but not fantastic. We had a caprese salad that was terrible, an arugula salad that came out first with more than 50% bad arugula (was quickly fixed, but STILL), and chicken parm was not great. Arrabiata sauce was great though, as were my kids' meatballs. And three stars instead of two for having whole wheat and gluten free pasta options. The server was SO nice, so I feel bad even writing anything negative, but need to be honest!"
Five,"Let me start off by saying I LOVE Benihana. There isn't one in the area where I live so whenever I'm out of town I try and go there for lunch or dinner.\n \nMy family and I had a reservation and they were ready to seat us when we arrived. The waitress was cute and super friendly, our chef was also great. Now what everyone is waiting for, the food was EPIC! I don't know if I've ever had a better meal at Benihana. \n\nIf you're looking for an awesome meal plus good entertainment and you're willing to spend some money to treat yourself, I would definitely recommend dining here."
One,"Great idea, but fail execution.\n\nWell... I don't know about great, but it is certainly an interesting idea. Almost clever. \n\nGoing here was my friend's idea - it was either this or get that gastronomical abomination from KFC where they give you a bacon and cheese sandwich and then replace the bread with deep fat fried chicken. I don't like KFC, so I went with this. My choices might as well have been a kick in the face or a stomp on the nuts.\n\nI didn't know what to expect. We walk past the ambulance into the restaurant. The air was thick inside. Oily. I quickly notice that everyone is wearing hospital gowns while devouring their meals. If peopleofwalmart.com was a movie - this would be the cast. \n\nWe found ourselves seats and were greeted by a sweet young girl who put a hospital wristband on us and then came around to put on our gowns. The place is staffed with cute girls in nurse costumes. I look down at the menu and the choices are called bypass - the severity varied by how many slabs of meat they put on. It was all kind of fun at first.\n\nI ordered the lightest thing on the menu - a single 1/2 pound burger - also an order of fries (which are unlimited refills) and a water... outside of water, my choices are sugar drinks or beer. My friend ordered a Double Bypass which was a pound of meat, also fries and also beer. \n\nThe fries were cooked in lard - they didn't taste too bad, but were not crispy or special at all. They just weren't worth getting up for seconds. Soggy, floppy and flavorless... just something to deliver salt to my stomach.\n\nThe burger arrived in a paper tray looking like a sad heap of grease. The bun was glistening - soaked with grease. Butter? Lard? Motor oil? I couldn't be sure, but the first bite told me I didn't want a second. I peeled the top bun from the burger and plopped it in the tray. I attempted to take another bite or two, but couldn't take it. The meat was sub-par shitty, fatty grocery store beef. The cheese was cheap tasting as well. \n\nNot that I expected wine and caviar, but for food this cheap and shit tasting, I wouldn't expect to pay so much. \n\nI didn't eat more than a few bites of the burger and I didn't touch the fries much, but I still felt both full and hungry at the same time. I pretty much just ate a few pickle slices and drank a bottle of water. The waitress asked how I liked it - my friend loved it and said he would've had seconds. I said it was terrible and that I was dissatisfied. I didn't ask for any money off the bill and she didn't offer it either. \n\nEven though I didn't eat it, she charged me 12 bucks or whatever it was. I wasn't entitled to not having to pay or anything - I mean, I ordered it. I should've known what I was getting into. Still, many restaurants would've bent over backwards to make me happy. I can't really bust them down a star for this, but even if I could there's no option for negative stars. \n\nHeart Attack Grill served me one of the worst burgers I've ever had. The novelty of it wore off as soon as my food arrived. If you want to eat an unhealthy yet savory burger/fries meal - go to in'n'out burger.\n\nI will never eat here again. I like greasy food sometimes, but I would rather eat a stick of butter and wash it down with bacon grease. Seriously - fuck this place. \n\nThen again... my friend loved it, so you never know."
Five,"""Some might be satisfied with the blackened cardboard and meat filler they serve down the street from Two Hippies at \the place which will remain nameless\"""" (yellow arches may or may not be involved), but I, for one, love to bite into a burger that tastes of beef and zany condiments.\n\nI've long been a loyal customer Lucky Boy on 16th and Osborn for their burgers and fries.  I've gone there off-and-on for around 5 years, but I think after eating a Bacon Burger with fries from THMMB's, I've become a convert.  Not only was it good, it was better than any other burger I've had in the downtown/metro area.  \n\nIt's official: everything Two Hippies does is delicious magic.  Hooray for local Arizona businesses that outdo the competition (including competition from national chains!)!!"""""""
Two,"""This review will be slightly skewed, as I only had dessert here. We might have had more had we been greeted at the door and offered a menu or a smile. My husband and I walked in to check drink prices and considered bringing our group over to their very charming patio. This restaurant is very clean, appealing and has a lovely atmosphere and decor. \nSo we waited for a bit for someone to talk to us and when no one did, we grabbed a menu ourselves and checked out the selection. Quite a nice wine list and variety. Somewhat pricey for a birthday drink-fest, though so we headed back next-door. As we were walking out, a server said \oh you're leaving?\"""". Well, yes we are and no one even noticed we were here. \nPart two: after being denied dessert next door I came here to request any type of dessert to go and would pay whatever it cost. If it was up to Greg at the front, this would be a 5 star review. He sounded confused and unsure, but did check and was friendly. He said the chef didn't like to make it to go, as the presentation would be off. I understand this and know they take such pride in product, so I explained this would be okay, I would certainly take into account this isn't a typical presentation and appreciated them doing it. I then ask if they have a candle. I'm told no. I ask what those small flickering tea lights are and am told \""""a candle\"""". Yes, unconventional, but what can one do in a pinch? So Greg gets one for me. Thanks Greg. So now I'm pretty happy and waiting and a server, possibly even manger by her demeanor walks into the kitchen and loudly says a disgusted \""""REALLY?!\"""". I hear them talking about what apparently is my awful request for a to go dessert with a tea light for the birthday boy. After ranting and rolling her eyes she walked out and pretend smiles at me. Puh-lease. \nGreg hands me the dessert (no fork, but that's okay) and I gladly pay my 7 bucks while also tipping him 7 for being hospitable. The dessert was vegan and incredibly tasty. It actually had French fries that tasted like gummy worms! \nSorry Nobuo. If I hadn't gotten mocked we would have for sure been back for a romantic dinner and some drinks soon."""""""
Four,"""My overall experience was good, however some elements weren't so hot...\n\nRoom: \nSucked. I stayed in what I believe was most modest accommodation they have (think they call it the \wonderful\"""") and space-wise it was a little cramped. The bathroom wasn't \""""sufficiently separated\"""" from the main room (I won't go into greater detail than that :). Also I'm not a TV person, but if I was I'd have been pissed off about where they placed the flatscreen. You can't watch TV comfortably from your bed (and it's not like there was any other place to relax in room). \n\nStaff: \nFantastic. From the front desk people, to the concierge (Alyssa), to the waitresses in all of their bars and restaurants, everybody (and I do mean everybody) was really friendly and helpful. I've been to a lot of W Hotels that don't provide this level of service.\n\nEntertainment: \nGood. The pool is great during the day and at night turns into a decent hotspot. Not having to deal with the gianormous bouncer by flashing your room key is a nice perk. The location of the hotel is excellent, some of the bigger bars and clubs are a block away (and Scottsdale isn't known for it's walkability). \n\nFinal word: \nSolid hotel for a bachelor party, guys weekend, etc. It's very much a scene and is clearly targeted at the 20s and 30s \""""out on the town\"""" crowd. So if you're not looking for that type of scene, you'll probably want to pick something else.\n\nDisclosure: My friend who works for Starwood got me a friends and family discount, I paid around $150/night."""""""
Four,"""Let's be clear - I am rating my car buying experience and that only here.  I went out looking for a hybrid Sonata.  I showed up and Ryan assisted me.  I asked all of the right questions and also asked what did he NOT like about the hybrid.  The was a test.  He actually told me what he didn't like about it and explained in more detail how I need to look at justifying the extra 5k on the hybrid.  Once he explained the fuel savings and how the regular Sonata still gets great gas mileage, I realized I couldn't justify it.  I am pleased with his level of honesty (I am not entirely naive here, I suspect there are always other motivations) and test drove the limited Sonata and fell in love with it.  At the end of the night, he took the time to point out all of the features slowly when no other sales rep has ever done that with me to that level.  I mean, I didn't expect this from a Hyundai dealership based on my preconceived notions of  what \Hyundai\"""" is known for (being lemons).  I went back to the dealership to ask a question a week later and Ryan took the time to not only answer my questions but offered some additional info that he had told me but I forgot.  (it also helped that he actually owned a Sonata as well).  I gave this such a high rating because I've never had a car buying experience like this before and have bought over 5 new cars in the past. I'll come back here and give it a 5 star when my family goes back and they get the same experience."""""""
Two,"My two stars is for the food and ordering process.\n\nI still thing going to the restaurant to experience the organ and bring friends or visitors is a must.\n\nThey only accept cash or check and that is always inconvenient.  Very few places don't take debit cards and I contantly have to remind myself to go to the bank on our way to Organ Stop.\n\nYou wait in line to order your food and it bothers me that I can't get mushrooms on only 1/4 of the pizza.  Toppings are only done in 1/2.  After you pay for your food you wait in a new line to get your drinks.  Frustrating!!!\n\nThe pizza is not even worth eating, IMO.  The fried appetizers are decent- I like the zucchini and mushrooms but not so much the mozzarella sticks.  The salad bar is an option.  The beer and wine is CHEAP.\n\nIf you want ice cream after your meal that is a third line you wait in."
Four,"So happy I found this place! \n\nSo I have been looking for a good dry cleaner for a while here after finally having ENOUGH with prestige cleaners and their overpriced, under-served customers.\n\nClearly this place has a few locations, and isn't a mom and pop shop, but here are the facts:\n-Open Sundays (huge!!!)\n-Open 7am-8pm weekdays (also huge!)\n-Same day turnaround\n-Reasonably Priced\n\nMy new thing is taking my dress shirts here right before I travel and ask them to fold (instead of hang)... This way I get all my dress shirts army style folded, wrapped in plastic, packed into a nice box and ready to be packed... Makes packing SO MUCH EASIER.... If you travel alot, I suggest this, it's always important to look fresh ;) !"
Four,"""New Yorkers outside of New York strike me as really obnoxious. They're always going on about the frickin Yankees, bitching about how there's no good pizza for thousands of miles, or, when they feel sappy, whining about how they miss autumn. When I kindly suggest that they move back to this seemingly wonderful place whence they came, they always respond with some variation of \Fuck off.\"""" Just trying to be helpful!\n\nSo I was a little skeptical of Native New Yorker, but that was dumb, because this is a first class establishment. Immediately striking is that the sports bar portion of the building is well-lit, awesome since its a rarity in bars around these parts. Who can blame a man for wanting a good look at the ladies and what he's about to eat? \n\nAnd what he should eat is the chicken wings, because they're damn good, and this is coming from a guy that usually doesn't bother because navigating chicken skin and tendons to try and get full is a pain in the ass. Naturally the wings are served in a variety of flavors and intensities, similar to Buffalo Wild Wings except delicious. The \""""suicide\"""" flavor isn't overpoweringly spicy, but it certainly offers some kick. What really makes the wings special, though, is the texture. The very outermost layer of these meaty delights offers a touch of crispness that might suggest a brief moment spent on the barbecue, but then your teeth sink right into the meat of the tender morsel. Plus if you come just for drinks and aren't really hungry, you can order as few as one wing for the sake of something to chew on. Grand idea. \n\nAlso, the karaoke here is pretty awesome because it's actual sloppy drunk people instead of American Idol wannabes, just like God intended. And the beer is cold. Amen."""""""
Five,"We eat here at least twice a month.\n\nThere are two things that set this place apart from most other dim sum restaurants in America, never mind just in Phoenix.\n\n1. A chef who loves to bake.  The head chef, Sam, is constantly baking up really delicious specials.  These are typically sweets/desserts and they are awesome.  He will come out to the tables on a busy weekend with a hot baking sheet full of pastries.  If he offers, by all means, take some!\n\n2. Extremely accommodating service.  We take all of of friends there and that includes some very picky eaters, as well as kids.  I've never seen any restaurant go to such lengths to make sure everybody is happy, including making all kinds of off-menu items to satisfy the pickiest eaters.\n\nBottom line, it rocks!"
Three,"Went here for dinner on a Saturday night.  Put our names in...and only had to wait about 30 min. Not too bad. The bar was a little too crowded to wait there, so we went a couple of doors down to pass our time.\n\nOn to dinner...we had a great server.  He was super friendly, nice and was vocal with his opinions.  I would love to tell you that all of his reccs were spot on...but they weren't.\n\nWe started with the pretzels and the cheese fondue. DELISH.  I went halfsies with my friend and we shared the prime rib sammie and the shrimp caesar salad.  The prime rib sammie was mediocre.  The beef wasn't flavored at all, and when we got the fries, they were cold.  Hot plate, cold food..not a good sign.\n\nWe did get fresh fries, I didn't finish my half, and moved on to the salad.  The salad was good, but not great.\n\nAll in all, I would go for a drink and some apps, but wouldn't really want to eat dinner here again.  I may have just ordered wrong...but two meh things do it for me."
Four,"Forget Starbucks, they have the best coffee here. As a European it's clear that they don't know how to make coffee in America, until you get to Joe's diner. They have the story behind their coffee on their menu. The servers think apparently so too, as one brought me a cup and 5 seconds later another offered me a refill when I hadn't started yet. And she asked me if I was sure.\n\nThe pastrami sandwich was good. Not excellent, have had better.\nIf I could come in just for a fix of coffee I would be very happy."
Five,"""Why I feel the need to update my review on Bianco is beyond me, but after tonight I ended up more impressed and, even more satisfied with every visit.\n\nThis place is amazing, absolutely amazing... so humble yet so in tune with the kitchen and customers it would blow an entire 15 mile radius of chains out of business, if it hasn't already. \n\nI've looked over the reviews and the number one thing people seem to have an issue with is the wait time. \n\nAll I can say is, don't go here hungry or in a HURRY, and for god's sake go near CLOSING time if you really want to indulge here, who the hell really wants to wait 2+ hours for dinner at PRIME hour, I sure as hell don't!!! \n\nAnother issue I've noticed is that the staff is \snotty, hipster or too cool for themselves\"""".\n\nNot true at all, c'mon now people...You can't take your \""""I'M ENTITLED TO EVERYTHING AT THIS MINUTE\"""" attitude to a restaurant with one man in the kitchen, go to Chili's if your in such a hurry and save us all real foodies the headache and best produce :) \n\nKudos Bianco!"""""""
Five,"D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S!!  This place is was AMAZINGLY good! We came across it when yelping for a dinner/music on a Saturday night (Very cool you can make reservations through yelp, btw).  Ironically, no music but we were extremely satisfied with the meal.  Ambiance was a clean, open, minimalist, dark setting.  Has a romantic feel to it.  The staff was HILARIOUS!  We wish we could remember our server's name but he was someone we could have been friends with!  Very funny and knowledgeable of the menu, spices, dishes.  We started with the tzatziki and hummus plate..so addicting.  We shared the signature chop salad and let us make it very clear....GET THE CHOP SALAD!  It's a unique twist to the common salad, with a unique blend of marinated tomatoes, smoked salmon, pepitas, couscous and so many other yummy ingredients. We also shared the scallops that were cooked to perfection placed on grits and spinach.  Even the bread and olive oil were delicious.  One of our favorite places to dine in Old Town Scottsdale.  We will definitely return and highly recommend!!"
Four,"I caught 3 games here and also saw 2 games at Tempe Diablo and one at Peoria.  This was the largest of the three.  I had seats in grandstand on two days and once on grass.  \n\nFirst off, if you go late March, heat can be an issue.  Consider getting seats in the shade.  The day we were on the lawn, we went early to make sure our blanket was in the shade.  Lots of trees there so if you're willing to go early, its no problem getting shade.  The grandstand seats (bleachers with seat backs) were a bit cramped, but ok.  Bring a seat cushion or folded towel to sit on and be aware the last row of bleacher seats has reduced leg room for some reason.  \n\nParking for us was easy since we always went at least an hour before game start.  There's street parking all over, often right across from businesses asking 5 or 10 bucks to park in their lots!  We never paid for parking; just make sure you're not in a zone thats time limited.\n\nFood was fairly standard.  Didn't try the garlic fries.  The island noodles are unremarkable.  Lots of noodles for the cost but they needed salt or soy sauce or something.  Beer and lemonade vendors were always wandering around.\n\nI recommend either buying your tickets early (ie not a week before you go like I did), and/or using a ticket reseller like stubhub.  Surprisingly, I saw no scalper here, though I did at the other two stadiums."
Four,I enjoyed a fancy happy hour.  Was not economical like you usually think of happy hour being though.  Really enjoyed the spicy mojito but it was $8 a pop.  Tried the polenta fries.  I did not like the dipping sauce (the item said vegetarian but tasted like it had anchovies in the sauce.  ick!)  My husband tried the sweet potato planks and enjoyed them.  The best was the 4 cheese plate.  Mmm... next time we will just get that and a couple drinks.  I think with tax and tip we paid over $60 for happy hour.
Four,"Great beer and really good beer bread. You can sit at the very long bar, or on the patio, the two best places to be in the fall, winter and spring. Outside you enjoy the great weather, at the bar you are closest to the beer. The drawbacks are a relative lack of seasonal beers; a fruit-based beer always on tap and thus taking space from a more deserving beer that really tastes like beer and not some fruit soda enjoyed only by those who need training wheels on their beer (they probably drink Coors at home); and the freakin' summer when it's 110 outside. Four Peaks only has swamp coolers which are pretty ineffective when its hot and humid (July-September). Other than that, a most excellent place for decent food, very friendly servers and excellent beer (probably the best microbrews in the Phoenix area). There's not a lot of parking either. Apparently when they built this warehouse as a creamery a 100 years ago or so, parking wasn't given much thought. Stupid lack of foresight!"
Three,"I dont know...if youre just looking for a cheap Mexican inspired meal and a casual patio, its fine. I only give it 3 stars because the warm (thin but not too thin and litely salted) tortilla chips and green & red salsas were EXCELLENT!! Everything else was just ok. The quesadilla was ok, the coconut shrimp were ok, the grilled fish tacos were almost ok, the prickly pear margs were really sweet but ok. The service was ok. An excellent choice for ulyra casual watching sports or after playing sports (some of patio is actually covered in sand) - not great for a business hh with clients in high heels :-/"
Five,"I saw this place on a Food Network series in November. When my family went to Phoenix in March for spring training, I knew we had to stop here. It was the first stop after getting off the plane and getting the rental car. It was in a sketchy area in the town, and far enough from the freeway. When we were there, the workers gave us samples of the different foods. I got the chicken fried rice combo with jade red chicken and the pollo diablo. The pollo diablo had a nice spicy flavor, and the jade red chicken was also very good. The snickerdoodle was very soft and chewy, which was a good thing for me. This will be a permanent stop in Phoenix for Spring Training trips."
Four,"""I went here awhile back after hoodwinking my dad into taking out the family there.  He won't infrequently take us out for a fancy meal when we're all together but this place goes beyond our normal haunts.\n\nI found no faults with the food whatsoever.  Everything tasted just wonderful, all proteins were expertly prepared, and the menu is also quite interesting.  The heirloom tomato tart was divine, as was the duck trio which included foie gras with a sauternes reduction, confit of leg with coffee and the breast meat with lingonberry preserves.\n\nAs great as the food was, giving this place even four stars is a stretch.  And this is due to the non-food aspects of the place.  Actually I feel a bit sorry for the chef and wish he had his own restaurant somewhere else to serve this sort of food.  Kai is annoyingly pretentious, and extremely patronizing to Native American culture.  They pretend like it's some sort of homage to the desert tribes but it's really the opposite.  I wished the waiter would shut up after giving us all these greetings in the \native language\"""" and talking about the artwork and such.  They call their fry bread \""""fry bread from the teachings of the elders.\""""  Is that what the elders teach?  How to destroy a culture, build a huge resort on their land and then create an exercise in Western exoticism a la early 20th century Europe?  Did the \""""elders\"""" eat foie gras?\n\nI wasn't impressed by the team of four waiters taking our plates away all at once.  I asked our waiter for water and he forgot so we had to remind him again--or rather my dad did, in his usual surly way.  Sometimes when one gets involved with elaborate service it's even easier to forget the most basic things.\n\nAt the end of the day, though, I would go back again (if someone else is paying).  The food is spectacular, and I can suffer a lot for great food."""""""
Five,"""I asked my daughter where she wanted to go and have dinner. She texted me back, \Cornish Pasty\"""". I thought that she had dropped the \""""r\"""" in Pasty. I, not being of supreme intelligence, thought it was \""""Pastry\"""". So, I Googled, \""""Cornish Pastry\"""". The search result returned \""""Cornish Pasty\"""". Still, in my supreme intellect, I thought, oh they dropped the \""""r\"""" in Pasty. I clicked on the link to their site and then I realized that I, again, had been fooled by my supreme intelligence and in fact, the correct spelling was \""""Pasty\"""".\n\nNow, on to the hard part. I still hadn't had my V8 moment because I didn't know that a \""""Pasty\"""" was a culinary item. As I began to search the menu online, I thought to myself ( I would have thought to someone else, but no one was around) \""""Hey, wait a second......Pasties are a dish!!!\"""". But, now having seen the fare (albeit electronically), I knew I would love this food.\n\nAs with previous reviews the place is narrow and small. But, what they lack in structure, they make up for in ambiance, knowledge and service. I ordered the Bangers & Mash and my daughter ordered the Eggplant Parmesan. All I can say is WOW. The pasties were excellent. And, for dessert we ordered the Chocolate Bread and Butter pudding with creme anglaise. One of the best desserts I have ever had. I have truly expanded my culinary palette."""""""
Four,"""First time eating in. Pretty good. They only have one Salad (The Unica) that is on the healthier side of life; however, this salad is INCREDIBLE. I got it with the grilled halibut. Perfect portion. If your not counting calories than this place definitely gets 5 stars. They have a TON of gluten free options too. \n\nThey kicked us off the patio for moving one of the tables out of the sun which they said \violate the wheelchair policy.\"""" Understandable and kinda funny. Plus, who rolls in a wheelchair when its 107 degree outside? \n\nThe new-school electric menu is rather cool. \n\nGet sum."""""""
Four,"Fish Market gets a solid four stars from me. I hadn't been to Fish Market in four years until I went twice in the last 2 weeks. It's my friend's favorite, but he's a big fan of their sushi happy hour, of which I was skeptical. Both times (on a Friday and a Saturday) this place was hopping.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, the host had flubbed our reservation, but was super apologetic and hooked up some free appetizers, when there was really no need.  The crab and bay shrimp cocktail was just alright, but the ginger lime prawns with cilantro sauce was savory and stellar in its own right -- they should make that an entree.   Last but not least were the calamari fritte, which my friend remarked was the best in town.  You be the judge though. For dinner I ordered the misoyaki glazed scottish atlantic salmon with grilled veggies.  For what I thought was a small portion the taste of the fish made me forget about portion size, and who am I kidding? - I was stuffed on appetizers!\n\nLast Friday I had the happy hour sushi and was impressed, especially with the Senorita roll. This $18 roll is pricey but at it's $9 happy hour price is well worth it. The crab roll covered in tuna sits in a sweet eel sauce and garnished with sriracha sauce on top. It's a heavenly mixture of spicy/sweet, east meets west. Their $4 house chardonnay is a great value as well. The setting of the happy hour bar and the mixing and mingling of patrons makes it obvious that this is a regulars sort of place.\n\nCriticisms?  Very little, except to say don't go expecting to be wowed with ambiance.  The look is nautical and fish markety - hence the name. Dur. I love the fact that they actually sell fish, but on second thought, who the hell buys any at $19/pound?  And for those who are sketched out on the idea of seafood in Phoenix -- they fly it in from the coast fresh daily. But PLEASE FISH MARKET, please do something about the ghastly lighting... is it really necessary to have it so bright in there?!  Is this a seafood restaurant done classroom style?"
Two,"Not a fan.\n\nJust cancelled my membership. I signed up originally because of the youth programs and because it's within walking distance to my house.\n\nThe facilities themselves and staff are not the problem. I actually had good instructors for the classes and the equipment was in great shape and it's clean.\n\nMy problem is that it is way overpriced. Maybe in order to subsidize the low income members that go for free? I don't qualify for financial assistance so for $25 more, I could have a membership at Lifetime Fitness with every amenity under the sun for crying out loud. I think also because of their pricing structure, you get a lot of sketchy members going there. \n\nAlso, the main reason I signed up was for the youth programs, none of which are offered at this location for my kids ages (3 and 5) I guess because it's one of the smaller ones? \n\nIf you're single and low income or a student, it's a phenomenal deal. But families don't have access to many of the amenities and kids programs at this location and would be better off at one of the larger YMCA. Even at those you'll still pay out the wazoo if you don't qualify for financial assistance. Just not worth it for me and my family."
Four,It is so dangerous that this place is less than a 5 minute drive from our house.  I also believe we fall into the delivery radius.\n\nWe finally tried Thai Basil out on the recommendation of my brow aesthetician and we are so glad we did.\n\nWe ordered the green curry and siamese fried rice and it is delicious.  I am so pumped to try more of their curries.  The fried rice is nice and fluffy and satay chicken with sauce is super yummy.  We can't wait to order from here again.
Two,"""We went here for lunch one day and after hearing so many good things, I was shocked that I didn't have a great experience. We walked in and there was no one at the hostess station, but there was (someone who appeared to be) a manager playing with one of the televisions who chose not to greet us. So, we waited for a few minutes before someone showed us to a table, where we waited another 5-10 minutes before we were greeted by our waiter (who, to his credit, was swamped with tables). I can understand being busy, but the fact that there were two \managers\"""" walking around, and not helping customers was what bugged me. \n\nWe didn't try the wings, but I had a meatball sandwich, which was pretty good, but not good enough to entice me back for a second trip. Ooooor, maybe the NewYorkers sensed that we were both from CHI-TOWN and chose not to take care of us :) haha"""""""
Five,"Okay, I'm not usually a 5-star critic, since every dining experience can be improved a bit somewhere. But with the return of Trader Vic's special Chefs dinners the chef Justin Pfeilsticker (had to look that one up), outdid himself. Incredible.\n\nLast night's dinner showcased Cruzan Rum drinks and the chef's challenge, working with the sponsoring mixologist, is to coordinate the 4 courses with the 4 special drinks. Dinner and drinks where $65 plus we could keep tabs on the Suns in playoffs in the bar. In the end, I was kicking myself for not gathering all of my foodie friends to join me - they would have been in heaven.\n\nLobster, crab and grouper cocktail to start, paired with a classic daiquiri that was perfectly balanced. Second course; chicken and morel mushrooms (amazing) with black-eyed peas - matched with an amazing black raspberry rum cocktail. Okay, I admit, I had to lick the plate. There was no way I was letting that reduction sauce go to waste.\n\nThird course was absolutely prefect, fresh scallops and a sweet potato polenta with another incredible pineapple/butter sauce. Paired with a spiced rum mango cocktail that was smooth, not too sweet and really interesting.\n\nDessert was a crisp bread pudding with a bit of rum gelato and matching sauce. Not too much and not heavy, but just enough sweet to finish the meal. The cocktail was a whipped coconut creme. Delightful.\n\nNow my experience with Trader Vic's Chef's dinners is that they aren't planned that far in advance (whereas the Hotel Valley Ho's Zu Zu dinners are more consistent - and also very good). So getting a seat at the next dinner may require a bit of research. According to the manager, they would like to host one monthly through the summer and they try to limit the seating to about 60 to keep the food quality as high (and I suppose the drinks as cold). Since I recognized a number of faces from last year's chef's dinners - there seems to be a good following of insiders. And at this price for incredible, interesting and very special food (you should have seen the morels and fresh scallops) with all the drinks - it's a wonder there isn't a waiting list a mile long.\n\nSo 5-stars. No question."
One,"""I just returned from Culver's and lets just say my experience was not a good one. I will say that the place was very very clean and well kept (bravo for that). There were also nice, large TV's that were showing the football game. The two young boys working the cashier were very nice. My mom was taking quite a while to look over the menu and they asked if she had any questions etc. We ordered and went to sit down in the \dining area\"""". Once we sat down there were two employees eating. I assumed they were on their lunch break or had just gotten off work and were having a bite to eat. It was a male and a female employee. The male employee was extremely rude and obnoxious. He was sitting in the booth chewing up his food and opening his mouth to show his other co workers who were all the way across the establishment behind the cash registers. Everyone who was sitting in the \""""dining area\"""" was looking at him in disgust. You are an employee, yes you are probably 15 or 16 but really? I was so grossed out by this! The he continued to do that while laying down across the booth and flailing his arms and legs knocking into the table causing a lot of noise and a scene. I don't know who the manager is, but I don't find that acceptable at all. \n\nFood:\nAll of my midwest friends rave about this place. I honestly have no idea why. I ordered a burger. It looked nothing like what it was supposed to look like and the actual meat part of it was paper thin and crispy looking (ew). My mom ordered the pulled pork BBQ sandwich and they brought out something else but were very nice and responsive and brought out the correct food quickly. She didn't think the food was that great either. \n\nLet's just say I will not be returning, and maybe the management needs to reevaluate allowing employees to take breaks with customers, or else clean house. That is not acceptable anywhere for an employee to behave as this one did."""""""
Five,"""This is one of my favorites places to chow down in Arizona. It's an oasis of refreshing Italian food with hearty portions that won't break the bank - although they may break your belt! Most everything on the menu is extremely palatable from the salads to the sandwiches...but they do some mean pasta and pizzas. I'm a huge fan of the Big Rig pasta. And of course, they are known for their melt in your mouth dessert, the pizza cookie (aka pizzookie). Save room for this bad boy, because no Oregano's meal is complete without it.\n\nThe ambiance is really casual but fun, and the staff is really friendly. My fav location is the one in Tempe. It really is a place with \Menu can trust.\"""""""""""
Two,"""A Friday night; 1st visit; as we were told, place was packed and loud. Okay, we're prepared for it: yelling to be heard sucks, but we were forewarned. Also told that the place was \typical bar food\"""".  Hmmmmm.\n\nPROS: we were seated relatively quickly;  pretty decent beer; server was friendly and took satisfactory care of our table of 8; entire staff seemed like an organized, hard working team\n\nCONS: the food. I understand bar food is not haute cuisine, but 4 Peaks was just blah. Pizza undercooked--literally, dough was still moist in parts. Worse? You could tell just by looking at the pizza it needed 5 more minutes in the oven--why even serve it? Next issue: change the fry oil! Over half our table got something of the fried variety (I really hate bar food). In every case, the fried food had that really dark brown quality, indicating the fryer oil should have been changed after the lunch rush earlier that day! After I sent the pizza back and waived off the offer for a new one or another meal selection, I accepted a chicken strip from a table mate. It tasted as gross as it looked. \n\nI understand why some folks like places like 4 Peaks, but I have yet to find a brew pub anywhere in which I've said, \""""I have to return here soon!\"""" True, the beer was okay (I was drinking one of their IPAs), and I appreciated the hard working staff (BTW, server and manager came to table to apologize for the pizza I sent back AND comped us a pitcher of beer). I accepted the noise and the need to nearly yell to communicate, but I didn't like it.  But at the end of the day, the real issue was the quality of the food--poor to marginal.  I won't return.\n\nCheers!\nRS"""""""
Four,"My prom date brought me here 10 years ago. Hmm...I wonder what he was expecting at the end of the night. Although he thought that tanning until he was as red as a lobster was the new black this was one of his better judgment calls.  \n\nWe had a window seat and I mesmerized him with fascinating facts about the city, which were on little plaques along the windows. It really took him until the end of dinner to figure it out. Anyway, I am sure the menu has changed, but the salad and shrimp with angel hair pasta I had that night were yummy. Cool view. I will have to come back sometime to see how the valley has changed from this view."
Four,"Very cool dive bar serving up some great burgers! I finally made it to the Original Wineburger after living in Phoenix for six years and I'm glad I did! Last night I ordered the burger and fries combo. I added on cheese, bacon, onions, ketchup, and mayo. The burger came out about five minutes later and was presented to me in all of its cheesy and greasy glory. I was immediately impressed and I can see myself returning soon. Next time I will add a fried egg to my burger. I dig any burger place that offers that option.\n\nSylvia was my friendly server behind the bar and informed me that Wineburger has been open since 1965 and are not affiliated with any other Wineburgers. I'm curious to find out the story about why that is. She also informed me that they have live open mic music on Wednesday nights. It may not make #1 on my list of best burgers in the Phoenix metro area, but it is up there and I definitely recommend The Original Wineburger."
One,"Trying to capitalize on the Hooters gig, Tilted Kilt fails.\n\nThe waitstaff is OK. Having to prance around in those little outfits may please the male clientele but I don't know... maybe I'm getting old (or maybe it's because I have daughters that age) but it's kinda degrading... Our waitress had to be no more than 19....she still had braces. Looked at my receipt when I got home and she even charged us for too many beers. \n\nFood was typical bar food. I had a burger and it was no better and no worse than any burger I've had in any sports bar in America. Nothing to write home about. \n\nLots of TVs. I even got to see my beloved Phillies on a screen right in front of me.\n\nAll in all, it's a gimmick. Stay away."
Four,This is a great restaurant that is in between a true cheap chain and one of those super expensive one of a kind dining experiences. We went here for our office holiday party and we had 8 adults and 1 two year old. They pushed some tables together for us so we all got to sit together which for some reason every other restaurant in Scottsdale we wanted to go to was not able to accomodate. The server was helpful and prompt. They take reservations and I agree with some of the other reviewers that you should make one for busy weekend hours.
Four,"""The food is so good.  The menu is HUGE so I always get the sample platter thing because I can never decide on one thing.  Or, I go there at lunch time to get the buffet.  The buffet is always different every time I go.\n\nAnd, its vegetarian/vegan, so its always an option for the veg-heads.\n\nI love this place despite the violations that it received last year.  I heard about it from a friend who lived in India for awhile and she said \eh, it makes it more authentic.\""""  And seriously, what restaurant in Phoenix doesn't have roaches?  As long as I don't see them while I'm dining I don't care.  And, it's still open, so I assume that they have rectified the situation."""""""
Five,"Great food.  Great ambiance.  Excellent service.  If you're looking for a vibrant atmosphere, with delicious (and healthy) fare, do yourself a favor and try True Food Kitchen.  The food is good, but the service is impeccable.  EVERY single time my wife and I have dined here, we have been welcomed warmly and have been treated like regulars.  The staff is efficient, and is never in a hurry to just take your order and leave the table. The management is to be commended for hiring/training such a great staff.  The Scottsdale Quarter vibe means there is much to take in and some excellent people watching as a side note.  If you want to feel like your business is appreciated, and you want to support local business - make a point to eat here soon."
Two,"Not impressed.\n\nFirst I was sat at a table that was back to back with another person....we are talking 3 inchs apart.\nI dont like sitting that close to another group.....this place is tiny.\n\nBread was plain old italian bread...not warm\nServed with some olive oil...no pepper or spice....boring,\n\nSalad arrived....dressing was good....salad was ok....until I got the bill....$7....what a joke.\nI thought this place was a $$ not a $$$.\n\nEntree arrived.\nI got the cannelloni, pretty tasty meat filling and alfredo sauce.\nI like alfredo over marinara so I had them substitute it.....but I wasnt told that I would be charged $2.....another joke....been to may places and never charged to sub a sauce.\nMy girl got the beef stew over rigatoni.....she liked it.\n\n\nDessert.\nPistachio gelato with a piece of biscoti\nTasty....another $7\n\nToward the end of the meal the service slowed down to a stop and I stopped getting drink refills...no big deal as they were closing.\n\nSo a recap....\n$4 for drinks\n$14 for some tiny salads\n$34 + $2 for entrees with a different sauce.......dot dot dot\n$7 for 4oz of gelato\nadd some tax and a $12 tip...you get....\n$78....wont happen again."
Five,"With the exception that they should have made this one twice as big (you can hardly find a seat around noon) I've never once had a wrong order and sometimes I order some complex stuff.

The area is absolutely gorgeous but their food & service is just mediocre. \n\nOne event I went to was in the patio & sun room, and the other was in the urban barn. The patio was very nice but the room is a standard plain white room.  The urban barn is cute from the outside but the inside is a little janky. The ceiling and beams are unfinished ugly wood with the manufacturer stamps still visible and spray painting...they could have at least stained them a neutral brown. There are faux wooden beams painting on the wall. Not that impressive, but the area outside (we had cocktails under the carob tree) is beautiful.\n\nThe food and service is a different story. One of the meals was catered by Santa Barabara catering and it was fantastic. If you're hosting an event here, I recommend going with a buffet from the catering company. The other meal was a sit down, pre-selected 3 course dinner. The kitchen/servers had zero coordination. One person out of the table would get their hot entree a good 10 minutes before anyone else got theirs. It was near impossible to get beers and was impossible to get a refill of water. I thought the food was disappointing. I had:\n\n- Goat Cheese & Beet Salad: By far the best thing I had. Great dressing, yummy goat cheese, fresh greens. \n- Vegetarian Trio: So small and just okay. The grilled eggplant was very soggy and the tomato jam it was topped with was far too sweet for an entree. The arancini ball was delicious but I only got one...for my entree. If there had been 3 then it would have been a meal.\n- Chocolate Cake with Fudge, Fleur De Sel Caramel, & Buttercream Frosting: Amazing sounding description but one of the worst desserts I've ever had. The cake was so dry and barely had a chocolate flavor. There was about a tablespoon's worth of frosting and not even a teaspoon of caramel. So so dry and lacking the richness or flavor of a chocolate dessert.\n- Bread Pudding: Much better than the chocolate cake but still average.\n\nIf you're planning on hosting an event at The House at Secret Garden, I recommend trying to make it as outdoors as possible (prettiest) and not using their in house catering."
Three,"I have a friend who loves bacon - really, who doesn't?? - and after reading a few yelps on this place I figured we had to give it a whirl since most had tried the bacon wrapped shrimp and enjoyed this signature dish. \nThe bacon wrapped shrimp is stuffed with cojita cheese and the three flavors were delicious even though it wasn't that warm - like freshly prepared warm. More like heat lamp warm. \n\nI then had the seasonal salad with a side of their horseradish mashed potatoes. Really good! My friend had the surf and turf pasta and said he usually doesn't like fettuccine but he really liked how they prepared it with mushrooms and tomatoes. \n\nI want to go back to try some of their seafood entrees which sounded really good!"
Four,"A restaurant this painfully hip seemed slightly out of place in the small town of Scottsdale. But a nice find.\n\nThe place is small and long. It makes seating quite interesting as you can hear everyone else's conversations quite easily. Not the place for a quiet, romantic dinner. Come here to see and be seen, people watch, conversation eavesdrop.\n\nGood Italian wine list. Slowish service with friendly staff, jazzy electronic music. Food was tasty, kind of like an elegant new Italian with fun presentation. The cauliflower soup was amazing...thick and creamy with just the right flavor. My husband's veal was perfectly cooked on a bed of polenta. Speaking of polenta, I loved how my grilled prawns went with my slightly firmer polenta and the flavors in the dish. We shared the tiella as it was so raved about on Yelp...it did not disappoint. In fact, my husband was still talking about it the next day.\n\nOnto dessert, my favorite meal.Very tempted by the Nutella crepe except we can get it at any crepe place, so instead we opted for the banana brioche with chocolate disks and caramel. YUMMM. Almost like a banana caramel bread pudding. Needed a bit more sauce to make the buttery bread a bit more soft, but overall we devoured it."
Three,"Probably more worthy of 3.5 stars.  Damn the Yelp constraints!  Marketplace was pretty busy tonight now that you can actually go out in the evening without a gentle breeze feeling more like a blow torch in your face.  In spite of that, our wait to be seated was fairly quick.  But where was our server?  Outside listening to the band?  We need liquid refreshment!\n\nFinally our server arrived and apologized for the wait at the same time the manager arrived and also apologized and comped us an appetizer.  Wow!  We hadn't even complained.  We had the hummus which was very tasty but a little thin and a mango tandoori chicken pizza.  Nice combination of sweet mango, spicy curry sauce, and the grilled chicken.  Service was excellent once we got over the initial bump.\n\nWhile I usually don't plan to go to CPK, it's nice to know this one is there."
Five,"We went early, 8am on a Sunday for breakfast.  There was a 5 minute wait (although they don't quote wait times), and we sat at the bar counter.  The coffee was delicious, as was the daily lemonade.  We ordered an egg special with country sausage patties, homefries, and toast.  My husband is a huge sausage fan, and he thought it was very good.  The bacon was delish, and the pancakes were simply but fluffy and flavorful.  We will be back, but we will go early because by the time we left, there was a very lengthy wait."
Four,I had been here last year during football and vowed not to return after seeing the state of the bathrooms. Heard there were new owners and the first thing they did was fix them. Saw the Yelp coupon and decided to give them another try. Met the new owner who was really nice. They are trying new things including a country night on Fridays which I will definitely check out. Service was great and plenty of wing flavors to choose from. Onion rings were awesome.
Four,"""This is another home run from the people who brought us such wonderful places as Joe's BBQ and Joe's Farm Grill. \n\nLiberty Market is excellent for breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert or just coffee. Yes, I know because I spent many a day/morning/night studying for the bar exam here. They have a nice selection of beers and wine for dinner (or a particularly heinous lunch study session). For lunch, the Maiden Lane sandwich or the Farmer are my favourites and their pasta salad is an excellent side. \n\nFor dinner, burgers are always good but so is the \Best Chicken Sandwich\"""" which really is very good. For dessert, I always like their homemade chocolate chip cookie ice cream sandwich with a glass of champagne. \n\nThe market is also really nice for cute gifts and food items. Also, check out the bathrooms, seriously. Very clever and cute.\n\nThis place is awesome but expect to wait if it's during peak hours."""""""
Four,"""Ah, Dos.\n\nThe old standby. For the last 9 years, it has always been our backup plan when we wanted to escape the newest pretentious old town Scottsdale club. \n\n\I'm bored. And my drink was $10.\"""" \n\""""What do you want to do?\""""\n\""""I dunno. What do you want to do?\""""\n\""""Let's go to Dos.\""""\n\""""Okay!\""""\n\nInstantly a mood changer. Cheap drinks, rowdy people, good mix of music. Service is inconsistent. One night it can be great, the next night you can have a total a-hole bartender. Some of my guy friends have had issues with the bouncers. \n\nFood isn't the greatest but it tastes pretty good when it is 1:30 am and you know your only other choice is a long line at a fast food place. Gringo rolls are my favorite. \n\nGreat place for the young and the single. My girlfriends and I would have quite the time here before we all became married old ladies."""""""
Three,If you go here when its busy it's usually a bit under staffed. The sushi here is average but they do put there own twist on it. They add a little liquid smoke to all of there sushi sauces which adds a little variety. The first time I went here was about a year and a half ago and I wasn't to impressed with the sushi. My friend went back a month after that and they had gotten rid of sushi all together. Just recently they started serving sushi again so I decided to go back and try it and it was fantastic. Flavors are very different from most other sushi joint but I enjoyed it. They do a 19.95 all you can eat sushi.
Two,"""Meh.\n\nNot a bad place, I suppose... just not that special. Great beers on tap, I'll give them that, but it's a bar experience you can have at a dozen other places, honestly. If you're already downtown for some other reason (Suns game, dbacks, etc.) it's a decent place to grab a drink and some food, but not a destination place. I'd probably flip a coin between Copper Blues and Tilted Kilt, and not really care where I ended up. (both try to over-compensate for any potential shortcomings by subscribing to the \dudes like boobs\"""" theory.)\n\nWhy 2 stars? It's a mix. Service wasn't great, and I think i was just a little disappointed in the general atmosphere - I was really hoping Phoenix had actually gotten a Blues bar. This is just a bar with \""""blues\"""" in the name. I mean, the band was playing covers of top-40 hits. I mean... really? I guess I was hoping for some kick-ass old dude sitting in a chair in dim lighting that can rip out a couple BB King tunes. Or a great jazz quartet to pound out some Miles Davis. Oh well. \n\nGuess I'm just sick of bars trying to pander to the hip, college / scottsdale crowd. There's such a gaping hole in the \""""blues - jazz club\"""" scene in Phoenix  (by \""""gaping hole\"""" i mean \""""none\"""") and I was hoping this could help fill that hole. Guess not."""""""
Two,"""This was my second visit to the HSG. The first time I went for Blues In The Barn. The entertainment was my favorite local bluesman, Paris James. The barn was very cold and the servers insisted on leaving the doors open. Service was slow and the menu was limited, not the same as in the main restaurant. But the entertainment was wonderful.\n\nWhen a friend suggested going for dinner I was interested to try some items from the full menu. I arrived early, not knowing how bad the traffic would be. It was 15 minutes before the restaurant opening time. The door was unlocked so I went inside, stated that I realized I was early, but would it be ok to just get a glass of wine and hang out until my dinner companion arrived. I was told \no\"""" in no uncertain terms, so I went back outside to wait. Strike 1.\n\nWhen my friend arrived she asked for a cocktail not on the menu and was told that they didn't know how to make it and wouldn't guarantee it would be any good, Strike 2. \n\nAs an appetizer we had the polenta fries, which were crispy and tasty with a zesty chile aoli.\n\nFor my entree I had the veggie trio. The presentation was beautiful. The portions were miniscule. For $16 I got 4 small slices of beets, a tiny tasting cup of delicious soup with toasted hazelnuts on top, and one arancini (fried risotto ball) with a tiny carafe of tomato sauce. The arancini was yummy and crisp on the outside and moist and flavorful on the inside. The beets were also flavorful. \n\nIn spite of having only three filled tables, service by two waiters and a wine steward was snail-like all through the meal, becoming surly when we asked for a coffee and a hot tea after dinner. We were never offered water, coffee or tea refills. Strike 3. \n\nAll in all, I will not be going back to HSG. I enjoyed the food, but the surly, slow service coupled with the expensive menu items make this spot a poor value in spite of the lovely old house and charming patio in which the restaurant is situated."""""""
Four,"I'm so not a 'pub & grub' kinda gal, but since this place saved me 2 times during a Science Center visit = pretty ok.  You can walk across from AZ Science and make this kid friendly pit stop in the middle of the day - i really am not familiar with anything else that 'now it's the parents turn' sorta thing close by.\n\nFun pool table in 1 of the rooms.  Really good steak fries, fish and chips are good, and so is the french onion soup.  Since i am a wine drinker, this is not the place for wines by the glass, obviously it is a beer place, and me not being a beer drinker, not my cup of tea - ah~hem, pint that is....\n\nsooo, all-n-all a fun thing to do after sacrificing for the kids!"
Four,"I decided to come here for my birthday and i'm glad i did, i had the ribeye with mashed potatoes. I ordered my ribeye rare which was cooked and seasoned very well. The steak though wasn't as tender as i thought it would be which surprised me maybe it was just not as good of a cut that day. the mashed potatoes though is another story i swear i was biting into clouds! those were some of the best mashed potatoes i've ever had."
Two,"""A huge disappointment.  I had been looking forward to getting to Iruna and experiencing what I thought would be an experience to all the good food, service and times once had at Sol Y Sombra.  Joke was on me and my friends!  \n\nI would give the service 1 star, but because a few of the dishes were very tasteful, I am giving two stars.  The waiter was nice, but did not belong in the service industry.  He called us \dudes\"""" (I wasn't on the beach and he wasn't wearing swim trunks, no need for \""""dude\""""), he kneeled on the table bench directly behind us, basically breathing down my neck when he talked (gross), never asked us how the food was, even when we didn't touch more than 2 pieces of the calamari (that was saturated in oil and desperately needed a few squeezes of lemon).  He took dishes away that we were not finished with.  \n\nThe food was good - some dishes were great and some were not good at all.  The romesco sauce served with the croquettas was delicious! I could have eaten just a side of the sauce alone.  It has just enough spice and the flavors were spot on.  The trout was another delicious dish.  The fish was cooked to perfection and everything on the plate hit the palette in all the right places.  \n\nThe calamari was awful.  It was over fried, and instead of serving with a lemon wedge, was served with a citrus aioli - the concept would have been great if worked with the dish. Even after taking the lemon from my water and squeezing on the dish, it was not appetizing.\n\nIf you check them out online and want to go try them for happy hour - sit at the bar (maybe on the patio, I didn't ask) but we were seated in the actual dining area and then told the HH menu was only available at the bar.  No biggie, but not the best way to attract repeat customers.  \n\nThe space itself is very nicely decorated, it was comfortable and had a lot of details that worked well with the rest of the decor.  \n\nOverall, I think they did a great job with the space, if they tweaked just some small things with some of the food items, they could make them much better and as for service - contrary to popular belief, just because you're in Scottsdale, doesn't mean your staff should be wearing Ed Hardy t shirts and calling customers \""""dude\""""."""""""
One,"The customer service here was absolutely horrendous. I was in a party of 6 and was told it would be 30-40 minutes to be seated. After checking back in with the hostess 4 or 5 times, it ended up taking over 2 hours to be seated. Apparently, the hostess was unaware that even though the 6-person tables were occupied, 6 people could be seated by placing together any of the unused 4 person tables with any of the unused 2-person tables. By the time we were seated, half the restaurant was empty but there was a large contingent of angry people still waiting to be seated. Additionally, the waitress was terrible, offered nothing to compensate for the long wait, screwed up our order, and argued with someone at our table regarding what she ordered. The food was good, but I'll never go back."
Four,"""I've been to other Souper Salads and I really like the location of this one.  nestled in a quaint part of a quaint shopping center.  Server staff could use some refining. \n\nThis is a salad buffet at a very reasonable price. For the price of a burger meal, you can load up your plate with whichever veggies you like, a choice of soups, and a few other \things\"""".  The veggies are generally very crisp and fresh, good variety, and decent dressing. I enjoy it very much.  I like a good salad, and I guess I build them pretty well.  \n\nGood choices, clean, decent all around.  I can eat healthy and enjoy it... I'm sold."""""""
Four,"I eat here about once a week, but usually get take-out. I'm in love with their cheese broccoli soup. I have it so much that I should probably start looking for a 12-step program. I usually walk in, order, and walk out with my food in just 2-3 minutes. I haven't tried the sandwiches or salads at this particular location, but elsewhere I've really enjoyed them. The food here won't blow your mind, but it's quality stuff and hard to top given the price, speed, and convenience."
Five,"""Another Yelper said that Chocolate Star Bakery was sent from Heaven! I could not have said it any better! \n\nI love that the Owner alternates cookie \specials\"""" regularly yet keeps the old faithful standbys always in rotation. This week I got lucky to catch the current special chocolate mint cookie. Yep! Like a grown up Girl Scout cookie. All chocolate batter w/ dark chocolate chips and mint chips. I just polished one off w/ a steaming cup of truffled chocolate tea. But of course milk would be equally as good. :)\n\nBut no matter the cookie special, I ALWAYS get the pink cloud cookies. They're pink colored soft shortbread. And since pink IS one of my fave colors....\n\nI frequently buy these cookies as personal and corporate gifts.  I always get delighted and excited responses! Just a hint for all you marketers out there. Stop it already with the mundane Panera Bread cookies in a box! :)\n\nEnjoy!"""""""
Four,"What can I say about Mint Thai? This is definitely one of my favorite Thai food restaurants in the Phoenix area. I little family run place with affordable prices and very good food! This is where I first fell in love with Mussaman Curry! They make a great one here with potatoes, shredded beef, peanuts and onions! The appetizers are really good as well my favorites being peanut satay and their spring rolls! The Thai Iced Tea is about three sizes bigger than most places. They don't skimp on portions here! I'm a fan for sure!"
Four,"Its my go to Japanese Restaurant in Arizona. Name is originated in Kyoto, Japan, where the owner is from. So You can expect real Japanese food here.   The got some American sushi rolls here, so all the roll lovers can enjoy the sushi also.  Although I haven't tried their sushi's I expect it to be pretty fresh and good.  Can be pricey, but that is what you expect when eating at good Japanese restaurant. I only saw one other customer when I was there, hope people in AZ are more into experiencing Japanese foods."
Five,"I had been anxiously watching Baby's move in to their new location.  I was hoping it was a tasty as it sounded!  Boy was it ever!\n\nI ordered a Mediterranean Chicken Pita and My husband tried the Philly Steak.  We were both exceptionally happy with the food. The vegetables on my pita were so crunchy and delicious, the feta was smooth and yummy, the pita was super soft, and the chicken was perfect too!  The food was made quickly and the employees were friendly and helpful!!  They even came around and offered us a free piece of the most delicious lemon tart for dessert.  \n\nI was craving Baby's again by lunch time!\n\nIf you are looking for a quick and casual dining experience in Glendale you have to check out Baby's!"
Five,"I just really love the Alwun House. I have been to several events there over the last couple of years including the Monster's Ball this past Halloween weekend. For each event I have gone to, the artwork in this art house was very relevant to the theme. I like being able to see art while I am getting my party on! The cover to the events are reasonable and drinks cheap. They also typically have complimentary appetizers which is always welcomed with long lines. \n\nEntertainment (besides the always interesting people watching) usually consists of some performance art, magic tricks, DJs spinning beats, and my favorite, a burlesque troupe (Provacatease). At times a little kooky, I always find it enjoyable and have a great time at these parties. The crowd is varied and full of fun weirdos. I love it! \n\nBesides the main events, Alwun House also hosts speakers, poetry and rotating exhibits. You can become a member for $25 a year, too, which helps support this local spot."
Two,"Oh Sprinkles. When I moved right around the corner from you, I was SO excited. I got you pretty often (considering the secret code to get a free daily cupcake and being that close, how could I pass it up?!) but the more I thought about it, the more I wanted to stay away. I have since tried other local cupcake bakeries, a few not so good and a few were amazing. I had my last Sprinkles Cupcake I will ever eat today, Sprinkles continually has hard, dry cupcakes and I am over spending $3+ for 1 cupcake. Not worth the hype, and I feel as if the girls who work here don't know how to smile (a little customer service goes a long way ladies & gents!). Sad really, I used to adore this place so much. I am giving it 2 stars only because they do offer the daily secret word to get a freebie."
Five,Well not much to update here it's still damn good and it's only been 5 days since last visit.  \n\nToday I had:\nPulled Pork Sandwich with Southwest Slaw and mustard bbq sauce.  It was amazing the slaw alone was outstanding but then pile it on top of a mound of smoked pork goodness and top it all off with tangy sweet sauce and you got yourself a winner.  \n\nI also had a side of bacon mac and cheese obviously it is a must and it was just as amazing as last week.  \n\nBest thing is he is going to be by my job in two days with fresh brisket : ) I can't wait.
Four,"I have been to Studio Movie Grill many times with family and friends and every time was an over all great experience. We always go at busy times (Fri. and Sat. 7-9pm)\n\nYes, one or two annoying or minor things may happen but that can and does happen where ever you may go. We had a worse time at the Costco two miles down the road that we have ever had here.\n\nThe food is overpriced but the portions are huge and all the food we tried was good. Besides, they have to make $ somewhere when they keep putting up $5 movie/drink deals on Groupon. Which is an amazing deal BTW. I even drive from Warner/101 all the way to Scottsdale and it's cheaper than Harkins for 4 people. You are not required to buy the food.\n\nFor the ranch lovers out there, they have the good stuff like Red Robin. :)  The fries are yummy, thick and crispy. Most items served with fries are in a square bowl so  the bottom fries get soggy under your other food but I don't mind and they still taste good  \n\nThe food servers in the theater polite and very fast to respond to your call light when you need something.  The food comes out quickly and they don't dawdle with the check but are still polite and don't bring it while you are in the middle of eating.\n\nThe front lobby area is clean, open and spacious with plenty of seating at and away from the bar.  The bathrooms were clean and well stocked. \n\nThe non counter seats are nice and have the little personal swivel tables. The seats rock a little and are the leather type material, cup holders in the arms.  The counter seats are just black leather office chairs, they are not the best, but still fine for watching a movie. If they upgraded those chairs then I'm sure they would get better reviews but they would still have to roll so you can get in and out from the counter easily.  I went once with a friend of mine whose son is in a wheel chair and those seats were great since we just moved the office chair and rolled the wheel chair right up to the counter. \n\nPopular/Blockbuster movies do require standing in a line 15 mins or so before the start time but I've seen that at all theaters.\n\nAll seats are now reserved without the $3 up charge which is great. No scrambling for the best seat during the rush. **Warning, if you have a Groupon then you can't buy tickets ahead of time on-line so get there early to pick the seat you want if you are going on a busy night to a popular movie. When you hand over your Groupon at the ticket counter they have your pick your seat on a little, ipad sized screen.\n\nJust try it and don't go expecting it to be the Ritz and you will have a great time."
One,"I should have went to the Safeway next door for sushi.\n\nThis was the first time I went to sushi joint, looked at the menu and decided that the best sounding thing was the steak. I opted for the grilled salmon and wasabi mash. While I am a huge sushi fan, the price of the rolls were a wee bit more expensive than some GOOD sushi places I went to. My friend opted for a bento box that had a crab nigiri (which was simply a half a stick of imitation Krab on top of rice). So sad. \n\nMy plate arrived and looked like a garden threw up on my plate. The steamed veggies were scattered around my plate like the salad shooter malfunctioned. The grilled salmon was just okay, served on top of wasabi mash that was also just okay. \n\nThe server was also very clueless. She brought over a bowl of miso soup and sat the soup between my friend and I. I wasn't sure who it belonged to so I asked for straws so we could share. =) She didn't think it was too funny. She said she wasn't sure whose meal it came with so she just left in the middle so we can figure it out. (THANKS!)\n\nBy the way, the waitresses were wearing traditional Chinese dresses. Shouldn't they be in a kimono or something? Who is the smart white guy that owns this place?!\n\nI walked away from Zen 32 and I won't be back."
Four,"The best thing about Fresh and Easy is that you can get in and out quickly and easily. It's not like a Fry's or Safeway or even Trader Joe's where it's impossible to get in and out quickly if you just need a few items. I do my regular grocery shopping here, although it's similar to Trader Joe's in that the selection is somewhat limited, so when I'm cooking something unusual I still have to go elsewhere for certain ingredients. But for your everyday grocery shopping, it's great. Prices are middle of the road. A downside is many items come prepackaged. For example, I needed two serrano chiles today, and all they had was a large one pound bag, so I'll have to go elsewhere for the chiles. But these downsides are pretty minor, and after shopping there a bit it's easy to get used to planning for those quirks.\n\nEven though they have a smaller product range than the usual grocery, they still have a few items that are real treats and not so easy to find elsewhere: arugula, pomegranate arils, figs, and a nice selection of unusual international items. Oh and they have San Tan Brewing Hop Shock in cans. Nice!"
One,"""Beware, don't call this place.  We drove home from vacation to a locked house and 3 tired kids in the car.  The lady on the phone quoted me a $49 fee and would not give me a ballpark # for the actual \unlocking\"""" of my door.  She could have easily quoted me that their most basic service fee is $98, which she was happy to share when I called to discuss with her after the fact.  When the man arrived it took him literally 1 minute to open our door, about the most basic unlock you could imagine.  He charged us $49 for the service call and explained that the $55 pays for unlocking the door, $104 total.   When we called back to discuss with the receptionist, she said that the price is quoted on the answering machine before anyone picks up... not so.  The whole process was unclear, dishonest and unprofessional.  Should have checked yelp first, but when it's 113 and your kids are tired, the last thing you want to do is call a bunch of numbers.

One,"""My experience with this Walgreens is slightly different from Brad's.  I had oral surgery yesterday and I went in to the store because there was 6 cars waiting for the drive-thru and this is the only pharmacy even close to my house.  After waiting in line 10 minutes just to drop off my prescription, the guy could notice I was in a great deal of pain and said he'd get my prescription filled within 15 minutes.  I decided to sit in the waiting area and suffer in silence.\n\nFirst off, I can't believe the authorities allow them to sell medical supplies, treat patients (they have a little doctor's office in back) or fill prescriptions here.  This place is a disgusting mess.  There were 3 chairs available for me to sit in, one had garbage on it, one had what I can only describe as a \snail trail\"""" on it and one was tucked in the corner under some advertisements and next to the busy staff door.  After wedging myself into the only \""""clean\"""" chair I started the long painful wait at Walgreens.  Once I left the store, I wanted to take off all my clothes in the parking lot and burn them right there.  I had the worst case of the heebeegeebees and didn't want to take that filth home with me.  ewwwww!!!  \n\nNow, I understand that they're busy and that other people too are in pain or need meds urgently.  I also understand that they have no control over the wackos that they let in the door and that they can't shut up that kid who is screaming and throwing a fit.  But they could at least, at very minimum, be somewhat accurate with how long they tell you it'll be.  I wouldn't have waited if they told me it was going to take 40 minutes.  I don't think I would've waited if they told me 20 minutes.  And from here on out, I won't wait at all, no matter my condition. \n\nDoes anybody know of a good locally owned pharmacy???"""""""
Four,"My favorite coffee shop in Phoenix. Step into this joint and you feel like you have been transported to a more cultured and diverse place. Its the first time I saw an Asian Barista in Phoenix. \n\nI usually come here to study and truthfully it gets a little loud at times so bring earplugs or anything else to plug your ears with. And on weekends you may have trouble finding a seat cause the place is packed. This place needs more outlets and the wifi can be sketchy at times. That said though I have a lot of love for independent coffee shops this one included.\n\nThey make pretty good white hot chocolates here. If you get a chance try one of their italian creme sodas ( i like peach). However, good drinks is only half the battle for a coffee shop, the joint also needs good bakery goods. Now the great thing about Lux is that I am pretty sure they bake most if not all their goodies on the premises. Hence, sometimes when walking towards the bathroom area your nostrils are greeted with whiffs of deliciousness. (theres a joke in there somewhere) Their Mexican Tea Cookies are always a good bet, and are reasonably priced. What I also like about this place is that they have rewards cards which I made ample use of. The Baristas in general are pretty cool laid back folk. \n\nSo if your looking for an awesome coffee shop experience look no further then lux and if you don't have a car don't worry. Theres a lightrail stop right in front of it."
Five,"""Ok, so I had been scouting this place out for a while, mainly because it looked like such a dump and was located next to a bus stop.

Five,"We take our family here nearly every week. The food here is great, and the prices are very reasonable. Our favorites include the Buffalo Chicken focaccia (as someone else has mentioned, this is really a thick-breaded wrap), the burgers, the onion rings, and the fries. The best item on the menu, though, is the fried cheese stick appetizer. They wrap the cheese in what appears to be wanton skins and fry them up - amazing.\n\nAs sports bars go, this isn't the place to watch every detail of a big game. However, they have lots of tvs with a good variety of sports on - more of a diversion than the actual main event of the restaurant.\n\nIn all, this is our favorite local restaurant."
Four,"One of my friends recommended this place for a sushi spot in downtown Phoenix near the light rail. The location is south of the Roosevelt and I must have driven by it many times. I enjoyed the bar seating which allowed me to view all of the house specialties of which I will be back to try. For starters I had the spicy salmon served in baby greens, cucumber, avocado, radish sprouts, seaweed in spicy creamy dressing presented in a martini style glass. It was delicious! Since I love to sample, we ordered a few different rolls and some sashimi as well. The spicy yellowtail was delicious and fresh. My favorite was the volcano, with crab meat and a crispy outter shell and volcano sauce on top. I had a sake that I have not been able to find anywhere else. If you're a fan of sake, the must have here is the Shirakabe Gira. Overall, this place was delicious although a little pricey. I think the quality would justify the expense."

Four,"Just had a bday dinner here last night, and the food was amazing!\n\nCripsy Calamari - 4 stars! It's more like a salad of Mizuna leaves with a light Yuzu dressing tossed with crispy calamaris. The golden-colored calamaris were crispy and tasty, and with the combination of mizuna is just mouthwatering!\n\nBacon Wrapped Pork Tenderloin - 5 stars! I'm just going to admit that this is very of the best pork tenderloin i've had for a long time! The juicy sliced meat with a bit of smoked bacon flavor on a bed of parsnip puree, hmm, heaven! \n\nScallops with 'forbidden' rice - 4 stars. I really like the 'forbidden' rice (aka black rice, just like brown rice, it's very healthy!) in accompanied with the seared scallops. Somehow I felt the scallops were not cooked as evenly as I thought it should be, maybe because it was lined on chive(?) skewer?\n\nThe only reason made me take off a star was the service. Our waitress somehow didn't show up after like 10 mins wait although the table next us who came later than us got served immediately, at least have someone to take a drink order? The place doesn't look busy, it was disappointing to have slow service on a Wednesday night. \n\nI'd definitely go back just for the calamaris and the pork tenderloin!"
Three,"My biggest problem with David's is its identity. First is the menu. It's a fusion of 50's style dinner food and Mexican. Then there's the decor. It's neither 50's nor Mexican. Oh sure, oldies, mostly 50's play on the sound system but that's where the correlation between the menu and decor ends. To their credit David's does put out a great burger and the tacos aren't bad either. The chips are served warm and the salsa is actually homemade and quite tasty. I've been here twice and both times there were no more than 3 tables occupied. Even so the service isn't great. If your timing is good you might pass by when the owner is outside handing out 20% coupons. David's is nestled between the high priced trinket shops and restaurants of touristy Old Town Scottsdale. Somehow the place just doesn't fit but the food is good and inexpensive"
Three,"""Went in for a quick after-lunch coffee. I thought I'd been to Cartel (a different location) before but I couldn't find my review... anyway, it was decent, but I'm not seeing the hype. \nI got a macchiato - espresso with steamed milk - and it came in a TINY little tea cup. When I ordered, the cashier said they only make it \traditional\"""" and I had no idea why he said that to me like I didn't know what I was ordering... I'm sure they get a lot of people in that expect the cr\u00e8me-laden chocolate monstrosity that Starbucks will give you if you ordered a mocha macchiato there. However, I hated that he presumed I had no clue what I wanted. With it, I got a chocolate chip cookie - which was larger than your average cookie and undercooked to perfection - but not really worth the price tag.\n\nThe cookie was $3 (yikes) and the espresso $3. Mom's mocha was another $3.  \n\nNow, I appreciate that they roast their own coffees here so you get a wholly unique flavour but my espresso was really bitter. Like, medicine bitter. I like a super strong roast flavour but I want it to also be smooth and flavourful. This was neither. Mom agreed about her mocha. \n\n3 stars for effort, environment (the window paintings were awesome and plenty of comfortable seating) and a great cookie but I wouldn't come back."""""""
Four,"Great place to see a show, with the following disclaimers:\n\n- 'traditional' concerts are best - if it's a show where you want to jump around, dance, etc. you're kind of limited to the space around your seat, and there isn't much.\n\n- not a bad seat in the place - yes it's tight but the place is old, probably built when we were a thinner nation.\n\n- the stage revolves meaning you're facing the band half the time.  I guess your view of this depends if you are the glass-is-half-full or empty type.\n\n- the staff is friendly, knowledgeable and professional, kind of like the Marquee in reverse.\n\n-  $5 for parking, but I can't remember the last event I attended where you didn't have to pay for parking.  Do agree with the 'get there early' comments.  It helps.\n\n- not in the best neighborhood but I've never had a problem.\n\n- decent food menu but if you want something more than ballpark fare you should probably eat before you go.\n\n- the bar/facilities downstairs are usually less crowded.\n\n- acoustics are solid, assuming the engineer is half-decent."
Four,"Solid Pho and spring rolls at the usual low low price. I stopped in yesterday for takeout and got beef pho with meatballs, spring rolls, and a Thai iced tea all for about $11. The Pho came with the usual toppings, all very fresh and plentiful. The spring rolls were big and packed with noodles, shrimp, and beef. My only complaint was that the iced tea was so sweet I'm pretty sure all of my teeth started to rot right there; I couldn't finish it. But I think that's just a personal preference. \n\nNo complaints about the food or price, and the staff was friendly. Clean enough place, I would eat there."
Three,"Nice upscale atmosphere and an impressive variety of signature sushi rolls and martinis.  The Napoleon Dynamite roll and Chai High martini were especially tasty (an odd combination, perhaps, but both were great).  The squid salad was pretty bland and the Whoop Bass roll had a weird flavor to it.  Also gotta take a few stars off because of the service.  We practically had to beg for water throughout the meal (NOT a pleasant experience while eating spicy/salty food) and there was a screw-up with the bill - apparently no one told the new guy that for some reason the 4-7 happy hour actually ends at 6:45...   Hopefully the service will improve over time, because this place is in a very convenient location and definitely has some yummy food and drink options."
Four,"As far as the chain breakfast -y places go, Village Inn gets top marks. This is my go-to pie spot PLUS you get free pie on wednesday if you order anything....like a coffee....so pretty excellent. The BF and I went here tonight (for free pie) and got breakfast for dinner.... They have the same idea as Denny's build your own grand slam, but I like this one because there are way more options and pretty good options too like crepes, waffles, omelets....all kinds of fancy stuff (for a place like this anyway). The service has always been good for me at this location, especially from the (I think...) manager. Everyone is friendly. I'd definitely hit this place up for a fairly reasonably priced breakfast....not for a wonderful super creative breakfast....just a....I need a decent breakfast for a decent price type. Go local if you want something special."
Two,"The service at this location was HORRENDOUS.\n\nWas not informed that soda is not included with the meal but milk, tea and coffee are.  So my son ordered a soda which was like $2.50 extra when he would have been happy with the free iced tea.\n\nThe salads came out with almost no dressing on them.  When I asked for more we were charged $.75 per salad for more.\n\nOrdered a kids meal for my 6 year old.  Was brought out a regular sized meal.  When I asked the waitress informed me it was an adult portion.  When I said I wanted a kid meal she took the adult meal back and made us wait about 5 minutes for the kid portion to come back.\n\nHad to ask for drink refills.\n\nWaited forever for the bill and even longer for her to pick the bill up."
Five,"""EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE! \n\nEven with Happy Hour in full swing and the place full of parched Winkies, the service at our large table was spot on. We barely had time to settle our bums and push the silver out to claim our table territory before iced H20 was before us, our drink orders were taken . . . and one quick blink of the eye and the \peacemakers\"""" were before us!  \n\nNow that's what I call HAPPY HOUR!\n\nBravo Thirsty Lion!"""""""
Five,"I haven't been to Zoe's for probably a year but I always love it when I come! As I typically do, I recently had the grilled chicken plate which is grilled chicken with sauteed onions, and your choice of a side (I chose their rice-yummy) and their greek salad. The salad is always huge so I usually save it for its own meal later. Their salad comes with their signature vinaigrette which is soooooo good. We also got a pre-packaged side of their red potato salad which is good, itself, but I like to put the dressing on it, too. My husband got the tuna pita and thought it was awesome. My brother went for the mediterranean pita and raved about it, too. The food is fresh and you feel you are eating healthy. The prices are average for most places, nowadays and I think the grilled chicken plate at approx $7 is a pretty good deal when you can make two meals out of it. Oh yeah, their fountain lemonade was out when I went but my husband recommended I try their freshly squeezed limeade behind the counter. I am a huge fan of limes and this was absolutely delicious. Not too tart or too sweet, just perfect. Love, love, love Zoes."
Four,"This is a hard review to right.  Again, I wish Yelp had 1/2 stars because it this review would really be at 3.5 stars.  I have been to several gyms before (golds, 24 hr fitness, tangible) and the one thing I hated at all of them were the fact that they were always busy with people who seemed to have an intimidating aura.  This place isnt like that.  It is quite big and has pretty decent equipment.  I usually go workout with my trainer (Jesse) around 530 and we always are able to workout with no waiting for having to share machines.  They have a lane pool, jacuzzi and sauna rooms.  It kind of reminds me of the YMCA downtown Tucson.  The only problem that I have with the place is the smell in the men's locker room.  I dont know if it is because they are in the basement and the sewer pipes are old but man does it smell!  The membership is kinda pricey but it is close to my house so that saves on gas right?"
Four,"This is the best pizza spot in Phoenix, hands down. You've gotta love the Italian craftsmanship that goes into each pie. Sausage, prosciutto and salmon are the house favorites and each pie comes with a generous drizzle of olive oil. The crust is chewy and fresh outta the oven, with delicious bubbles of char. \n\nThe atmosphere is reason enough to come here. This place packs the crowds in every night for dinner in its charming turn-of-the-century downtown home. The owners are sweethearts, the wine flows consistently and it's a vibrant downtown must-do. Skip it on First Fridays, though... the crowds can get too intense."
One,"I can't quite figure out why, but I've just never liked this place. Gave it three tries, and just didn't click. The cover charge irritated me... $5 to get into an empty room? Really?... the crowd seemed to consist of groups of 4-5 people who didn't talk to anyone but the other 3-4 people in their group... and the drinks were expensive. Somehow left in a bad mood every time I went there, and walked up the street to Amsterdam. I was SO excited for another venue to open up, and was really thinking that I would love it... but... no... just not feelin' it at all. Too much attitude for the new kids on the block."
One,"""Avoid this place at all costs.  I wondered around this store tonight for 30 minutes and not one employee could take the time to ask if I needed assistance.  I finally tracked down an employee and walked around, back and forth looking confused just to see if she would ask if she could assist.  NOT a chance ...she went back to storing some blind hardward in one of the kitchen cupboard displays.  I finally approached her and asked a simple question - if they had an adapter for a range hood (since the range hoods were 8 feet from where she was working, I though just maybe she might know).  I even showed her EXACTLY what I needed from the display model.  She says \I have no idea, but if we do it would be over in venting\"""" ... I oh, seems no one knows ... to which she snaps back in a snide, rude, and condesending manner .. I\""""M SORRY, I DON'T KNOW THIS ENTIRE STORE.  Wothless ....  Go elsewhere."""""""
Three,"A group of four of us went to Bloom for New Year's Eve. Great ambiance and preyty good service. We had a 6:45pm seating, so it was just starting to get busy. We really enjoyed the food except my lamp chops were so rare that it turned my stomach a bit. They did take care of re-cooking them properly to medium rare, but I had already lost my appetite. I am sure with the holiday, things happen. I was dissapointed that they still charged me because I couldn't eat with my guest and loss of appetite. I would probably go back sometime in the later rather than sooner future because of the experience."
Four,"Bangarang!\n\nNot only does Lollicup serve boba, tea and other assorted Asian drinks. But they also have a wide assortment of inexpensive food.  \n\nWhen you walk into a this place you realize that it must be authentic.  It is always full of real live Asian people who are having the time of their lives.  It is like walking into an Italian restaurant and seeing the entire cast of the Sopranos.  Sure you might be a little scared at first but in your heart you know that you are in for a treat/adventure, or a treatventure according to the word I just made up.\n\nI got the Thai Iced tea and The Steam Pork buns.  I have only had better Thai iced tea at the Thai Hut in Phoenix, but in all fairness that was after a night long bender in which one of my friends may have gained carnal knowledge of a melon. So it really is not fair to compare seeing as how my mind was already blown that day.\nThe Steamed Pork Buns were amazing. They do take a little while longer to make than normal. But when you cram that much awesome into a little bun thing it is best not to rush.\n\nThey also have an assortment of games that you can play while waiting or eating.  More places need to have games available. You here me Rose and Crown?  I want to play games!\n\nThere is a Bigfoot like rumor about free Wi-Fi here as well.  This has yet to be tested.  I will assemble a crack team of battleship playing nerds to asses this claim as soon as possible.  Stay Tuned."
Four,"""I came here after reading a few reviews and also since I am currently living about two blocks away.  When I walked in, I was surprised to see a very small crowd seated at the tables (which is a good sign in a way).  The main crowd was seated at the sushi bar.  So, I sat down at the far left seat where a \local\"""" immediately asked me: \""""Hey man, do you come here a lot?\""""  Of course I answered \""""no\"""" and told him this was my first time.  A grin immediately overcame his face and he proceeded with \""""suggesting\"""" to me what to order.  Typically I don't like it when folks insist on eating what THEY eat.  However, this guy seemed so enthusiastic for me to try FLOUNDER and a SCALLOP that I could not say no.  As I waited for my food to come - the local INSISTED I try some of his freshly ordered makeral - which he insisted I try to eat some of the \""""bones\"""" from his dish.  Of course I didn't want to insult him - so I ate the bones and smiled as I chewed.  Actually, it was not that bad.  The servers were nice and the chefs were fast and accomodating to my  requests of spiciness as far as the tuna HANDROLL was concerned.  I will probably come back to this place.  It was made clear to me that every single person sitting at the bar was a patron of not less than 5 years.  That IS a good sign of a good sushi place!!"""""""
Four,There really aren't enough TCBY's around. Or even just frozen yogurt places. Fro-yo needs to be in again at least in AZ...you can definitely find your fair share in California AHEM L.A. I mean ice cream is good and all but America has a weight problem and this may be why! \n\nI don't have much of a sweet tooth so that may be why I prefer frozen yogurt to ice cream. TCBY has some awesome fro-yo flavors including a mint flavor which I tried at this location. Usually I stick to swirl or chocolate. This location is a little hidden but you will find it near the blockbuster. They usually offer a tasty new flavor of the week which is out there and yummy!
Five,"My girlfriend and I went to Avanti tonight for an anniversary dinner.  It was because of Oscar, a 12 year veteran of the 37 year old restuarant, that we had such an incredible experience.  His thick Italian accent was a great kick off to the experience.  He not only helped steer me between two wines I couldn't choose between, but he also placed the bottle far enough from our reach to make sure that he was the one topping us every time.  He made impeccable recommendations on the menu, and timed the delivery of our food, dessert, and check perfectly.  We felt important; not rushed.  I made sure to ask for his weekly schedule before I left so that I make sure he is there to wait on us for future visits."
Five,"My friend hired these guys a couple of years ago from an ad on Craigslist. She said she was nervous about going off a random Craislist ad, but they ended up being great, so I used them for my move.... What a great service for a great value! \n\nDamien is the owner and he was very helpful and professional. They were on time and very careful with all of my belongings. They wrapped and padded everything. They moved a full bedroom set and a couple other furniture pieces and I think my move ended up totaling $130. I would highly recommend Muvit!"
Three,"Small chain sub shop with a weed theme.  They toast the sandwiches, and boy, are they good.  They have something for everyone-whether you want a plainer sub or a fancier one.  I always get the Five-O(ham, salami, pepperoni, bacon, and proscuitto), although one day I must try other sandwiches.  However, service is slow after you order.  You also don't get to see them assemble your sandwich, which is something I like.  They have the best sandwiches, but I really wished it didn't take them +15 minutes to do that."
Two,"The other night my husband and I came for a date night. My husband has always been big on this place but, I haven't. We always leave disappointed, this last time topped it off for me. We were sat and someone came up to us and got our drinks. Okay 20 minutes passes....no drinks. I flag a guy down and tell him and he says oh sorry I'm actually your waiter what do you want to drink. I was calm. Said my drinks  again seeing if he'd apologize. Of course not! So than! I try to say were ready to order and he already stormed off..... Fifteen minutes more we get drinks and I really wanted an appetizer but, didn't want to be there all night and realize i was glad I didn't order, their appetizer prices are entree prices. I believe that a plain cheese crisp was 5-6 bucks! Crazy! I ordered a pollo con Caso or something its similar to valle lunas fundidio.... (says my husband who was waaaay wrong) and asked for carne asada and was charged 3$ extra.. By the time we got it 30 minutes later. It was cold and the meat tasted like hamburger meat! Ewwwwwwww! I got one refill the whole time we were there.not by choice... I  was so upset and thirsty already ticked off I waited another 30 min for my bill! My husband asked for the 99 cent margarita and even pointed it out that the people next to us had it.... And he got a huuuuuuge one and then we told them it wasn't what we ordered and still had to pay for it my husband had two sips maybe because it was strong and he didn't like the taste! I finally had to hunt down the manager...I had to explain the situation....he didn't apologize just brought me my bill,.....didn't even comp us for the crap service food or wait times and we left. Glad to say I didn't tip! No way! Another thing e hostesses shirt was like see through and loose...she didn't leave any room for imagination and their outfits are cheesy anyways! Don't go Here! Pay the extra few bucks at Valle Luna or macayos......."
Four,"Been here one time. May 17, 2010 about 5:30pm. The place was not very busy. It was clean, appeared to be well staffed. Servings were on the large size. I had their hot pastrami sandwich and fries. Both were very good. My cousin had a baked chicken and deep fried onions pieces. He said both were very good. The service was excellent. We got served in about 16 minutes from order to plates. Drinks were filled without asking. We left an above average tip, I will most likely return. We had dinner for two and left after paying about $39 after tip and tax.\n\nEasy access off Tatum inside Paradise Valley Mall on the east side."
Four,"""Any review using the phrases \the meat is always tender\"""" and \""""peanut sauce\"""" is sure to be a four-star review or higher, right? Well this one is.\n\nMy parents love taking out-of-town guests here and we have not yet heard a complaint from any of our visitors. The food has been pretty good so far, but I have avoided ordering the pho as what tastes I've had from my mother's orders didn't seem to be up to par with what I'm used to (and spoiled by) in San Diego. Well, it's not San Diego, but for a Phoenix suburb, it's still pretty good food.\n\nIn terms of wait service, I find it pretty baffling what poor service others have reported. We have generally had pretty great service at Saigon Kitchen, particularly from Hue, but once in a while some of their servers seem a little disorganized and distracted. During my last visit, I requested extra peanut sauce (even though it doesn't usually go with the dish I ordered), and the waiter told me \""""No, this is the sauce,\"""" and pointed at the nuoc cham (dipping sauce). I told him that I understood but that I wanted extra peanut sauce. Finally another waitress with a little more sense told me that she could go get it, but I was just too annoyed by the other server who kept refusing a reasonable request - something my dad asks for and had just gotten a moment earlier, actually - that I told her I'd be fine. (And yes. I'm also childishly laughing every time I say peanut sauce. There! Did it again...)\n\nOther than a few minor miscues, I really enjoy lunch here. The meat is always tender and all the ingredients seem fresh. I like the shrimp rolls quite a lot. On my last visit, I ordered Vietnamese iced coffee, and at first was disappointed because it seemed kind of small; after trying it I realized that it was just too rich to be served any bigger. I'd order it again though.\n\nMy favorite thing is the combo bun. Shrimp, pork, and egg rolls - can't go wrong with this one. The shrimp was cooked perfectly and the serving size was ample.\n\nOne day I will have to order the pho, but again I don't think it will measure up to the hole-in-the-wall places in San Diego, and that's okay. I'll still come here with my parents and enjoy other dishes.\n\nAnd the peanut sauce."""""""
Five,"My sister is a huge fan of this place.  She insisted that my whole family descend on it for breakfast one of the days we were visiting, and we weren't disappointed.  They have healthy options (like the Bialy breakfast thing I got, yummy), as well as less healthy options like scrambles with sausage and Hollandaise sauce or huge cinnamon rolls, apparently also quite yummy.  Our waitress was wonderful - all of our dozen meals were out at about the same time, without problems, and we were kept stocked with waters, coffees, and OJs the entire time.  I'd highly recommend it!"
Four,"""This location is so good!  The counter staff were pleasant and friendly.  Counters, condiment bars, and tables were kept clean.  They have those awesome new coke machines!!  We kept going back up to try more soda flavors and combinations.  The burgers were good, cooked to order and done perfectly, like textbook medium well (which is how we always order our burgers).  Could possibly have used a little more seasoning (i.e. salt), but that's what the condiment bar is for.  Decent wedge fries.  The kids loved their nuggets and cookie.  I have to say that there is something magical about the jalapeno cheese sauce.  MAGICAL!!!  So good with the fries.  Same goes for their ranch sauce!  I know it plainly says \Hidden Valley Ranch\"""" on the ranch dispenser, but it tastes better than any HV ranch I have ever tried.  I don't know why it tastes so good there, but it does.  Believe it.   It's ranchy magic...and I am under its spell.  We'll be back."""""""
Three,"""I'll give a disclaimer that I'm not a local so maybe there's something the locals know that I don't. But as visitor, I have mixed reviews here. The rental car pick-up/drop-off location for all the care companies is FARRRRR from the airport. When you exit the freeway that says \Airport\"""", it's still like a 10-15 drive to the rental car return. Not even remotely close! The line is also somewhat long to check-in for your car reservation. I waited almost 30 mins to get my car 2 weeks ago. The staff is friendly though and I haven't had any problems with their cars. I'll likely keep renting from National - they can't control the location and all the companies seem to have long lines these days anyhow."""""""
Four,"""I remember when San Tan Village opened and made the news. Apparently the \family friendly\"""" town of Gilbert was being destroyed by the large Victoria Secret ads displayed outside their store at San Tan Village. \"""" OH MY GOSH, my eyes! Women in bikinis!\"""" A dozen people complained to the town calling it \""""Pornography.\"""" What are we living in, 1950? I just roll my eyes and laugh. \n\nI hadn't been to the shopping center since it opened even though I live really close. I took my first trip a few weeks ago and was relatively surprised. There isn't much outdoor shopping in this area, except for the usual sprawling mega strip malls complete with Super Target, Chipotle, PetsMart et al. \n\nThe layout is nice. You can park directly in front of stores and I've found parking to be fine, even on a Friday evening. \n\nThey have the usual selections from various malls as well as some  higher end stores, and a few I've never heard of. There's a small pet store on the north east end, off the main drag that has a really cute selection of animal collars for the same prices as PetsMart, but much more adorable. \n\nThere's a Sephora, Apple Store, and Lucy, which sells yoga and athletic wear. Their selection looked nice. \n\nI really hate the mall, with a passion. I avoid it 365 days of the year, however I love any type of outdoor shopping that's done tastefully and has a good selection of apparel, even if I don't shop all that often. It's nice to just walk around and window shop."""""""
Four,"Yeah. The place could use a once over with oxyclean, but the yummy food makes  up for the charming patina on the floor and walls. One of my favorites is the rice noodles with grilled pork, sprouts and crispy spring rolls on top. Comes with this sweet and sour sauce stuff you pour on top. Perfect light summer lunch. Also, the pho is a nice bowl of goodness. Squirt some hot sauce and hoisin on that and that is a perfect meal. Remove any eyewear to prevent steamage.\n\nBonus is the Vietnamese market next door. After lunch you can stock up on Botan Rice Candy, steamed buns and reasonably priced dishware."
Four,"""This place is getting me to let go somewhat of my perception that Bell Road in Glendale is gastronomically uninspiring. When I think of Bell Road, especially the Glendale stretch, I think of nothing but chain restaurants and steakhouses. I don't know if Le Chalet is an emerging chain, but it's already unique in that they specialize in crepes. Hard to find of great quality in greater Phoenix.\n\nMy friends and I went on a weeknight so it wasn't crowded. Decor wise, there is a lot of charm. The chefs wear beret-style hats. The dining area, and even the restrooms, have a cobblestone motif. Reminds me a little bit of an old toy store inside Fantasyland at Disneyland though less cheesy (pardon the pun). All the napkins are even bound in cute little cow theme napkin rings. The servers all sport the suspenders one would see on traditional Swiss outfits. \n\nThe menu is a cheese-lover's dream. Instead of ordering off the appetizers section, we had a regular Swiss cheese fondue for an appetizer. Cheese was just the right degree of sharpness. They bring the little fondue and long forks to the table. You can adjust the heat. Wish I had warmed it up a little more after some time had passed. Every table gets a little sliced tartine (crispy cheese bread) to start as well. After all that cheese, we each had a crepe for an entree. The crepes were folded into perfect squares with crisp edges and the filling and sauce visible in the middle. Also comes with 1/4 cup of salad with a garlic-mustard vinegrette. I had a smoked salmon crepe with lemon and dill cream sauce. I really loved the crispy outside of it. I wish I had tried one of the more exotic crepes. Some you might not be able to finish in one meal because they are filled with ingredients like potatoes and bacon. \n\nWe split a salted butter caramel crepe for dessert. Heavenly. It's one big, almost paper thin triangle on top of caramel with more caramel drizzled all over. The caramel was a luscious diversion for the palate. It had some almonds that were over-toasted but not a big issue. \n\nThe staff was pleasant. Next time, I want to try La Potence--what they call \The Hanging Man.\"""" A chef wheels out a cart with pieces of filet mignon hanging on a cylinder with little hooks and flambes it tableside over rice pilaf. A chef was demonstrating it to someone as we were getting ready to leave. He was thoughtful in explaining to us as well what he was doing. \n\nCan't believe I actually want to go back to that part of Bell Road but it's worth the trip. A great place for groups with its reasonable prices. There were people with their kids. But none of the kids were running around wild. Not surprising if the parents are  willing to do something like  fondue for dinner out with the children. Despite the name fondue, no pretension in the ambience. At the same time, it feels a little classier than say an Applebee's."""""""

Four,"No, this is not Austin-Bergstrom with its clean, beautiful terminals and new-car scent.  No, it's not SFO with its classical entrance, singingly busy hallways, and cool aura.  It is, however, one of the most efficient airports in the country, especially considering the daily flight volume.\n\nI agree that PHX needs a makeover in places, but terminal four's D Gates are nice and new (and thankfully where I fly in/from each time) and the rest of the airport is far nicer than disrepair.\n\nI have never experienced major traffic issues here, and although parking is a pain with lizards and birds running you from place to place, it's certainly manageable if you simply pay attention.  \n\nI've never experienced a long delay as I have in Denver and San Francisco, and the turbulence is only kind of scary in the summer when its 193 degrees outside."
Two,"""Meh, is right.  I've been wanting to try Vincent's since I moved to the area over a year ago.  I bought a groupon that I've been holding onto for way to long and decided that this was a weekend to go.  Honestly can say that I could have done without. \n\nOur first impression upon walking in was old and stuffy.  I get that your a French restaurant, but no need to decorate like we're still in the 80's.  Liquor bottles as a display? Doesn't look good.  It should have felt like an upscale restaurant, but it didn't.\n\nI liked that their menu is constantly changing.  Some of their menu options were actually pretty surprising.  My husband and I probably went with the least interesting choices.  I started with the lobster bisque ($8).  For our main courses it was lobster with basil linguine for me and beef tenderloin for him.  The lobster was just ok, the basil pasta was overcooked.  Mike's beef tenderloin was pretty good, but not worth the $34 price tag.  And none of the main entrees were under $32.  I get that you're a \fancy\"""" restaurant, but those prices are way too high.  I have no problem spending $30 on an entree, but it better wow me.  We'll just say Vincent's left something to be desired."""""""
Four,"I went here back when I still ate meat. The chicken was delicious and cooked just right. The salad was fresh and interesting. I consider myself a very picky eater, and everything was just right here. The french fries were delicious and crisp.  The prices were good for this type of place.\n\nMy friend ordered a burger and fries and also enjoyed her meal. \n\nI love the atmosphere here. It feels like we're not in Arizona, and that is always a nice thing.  I like how it's counter service, so no waiter is trying to rush us out of there.   I would go here more often except that I live in Phoenix now."
Five,"We came here Sunday morning for a wonderful breakfast. Our server was Colleen. She was very attentive and we had  a great meal. The menu is so extensive with many ,many options. I got Florentine Eggs Benedict and my boyfriend had a fabulous omelet with potatoes and toast. They were both delish!     Their Potatoes are fab!!   The Decor was very nice, and even though they were so busy,we did not wait long at all for our table.  Big parking lot and a nice waiting area as well. We will defiantly come back here soon."
Four,"""\Buddha Belly in the kitchen with a lead pipe\"""" would have been the right accusation for a murder that I would have had to plead insanity to caused by living in extreme summer heat if I had not stepped into Paletas Betty to cool off! Seriously? How do Arizonans do it? I'm a California girl, so I considered Paletas Betty like an air conditioned sanctuary....BECAUSE IT IS period\nTheir \""""popsicles\"""" are for an adult taste palate. I've had the Arroz con Leche, Mango con Chile, Platano, and the Durazno. The Arroz con leche is like a creamy, frozen Horchata. The Mango con Chile has layers of flavor that start off as sweet and silky then move on to the texture of chunky mango and then slap you back into reality with the heat of the chile. I swear it just leaves you wanting more frozen treat, resulting in you purchasing another. The Platano is like a frozen bananas foster with a rich vanilla note and chunky banana. I have to say that Durazno (peach and mint) is by far, hands-down my favorite. The flavors balance each other so well. The fresh mint is what MAKES this. It's like a frozen peach iced tea with fresh mint leaves in it. I do not hide the fact that I was dreaming about shamelessly devouring more of the peach-mint for at least 3 days after love at first bite.\nWhat makes this place even better is that they DO accept debit/credit, finding a parking spot had never been a problem for me, and they make a frozen treat for my dog too! He gave it 4 paws as well. Also, the people at the counter were always nice esp. when I tried to exchange my paleta because it had a bite in it (it's their signature to show it's legit); they were always patient with me when I was trying to carefully select what I wanted as well.\nDon't let yourself overheat, COOL OFF AT PALETAS BETTY!"""""""
Three,"I have a love hate relationship with Hob Nobs. Let's start with the love. It's within walking distance from my house, which is super convenient. Secondly, this place is adorable. It's located in a lovingly restored historic home, and there is always some surprisingly good local musician providing the soundtrack. Neighborhood cafes just don't get much cuter!\n\nThen there is the service,  it's always so friendly! These people know how to make you feel like family, and that's awesome. \n\nHighlights include the sandwiches, they are well made and always hit the spot - try the carver it's my fave. The dessert case display is tempting. Their cookies are dangerous, I try not to even look at them. One look and that's it, you're in for some serious, sugary, carb loaded goodness. Finally, one of my favorite things about Hob Nobs is that they stock local beer. I love that they patronize Arizona breweries so I can, too! \n\nSadly, I think what I find most disappointing is the food. Other than the aforementioned sandwiches, it is consistently underwhelming. Example, their pizzas, they taste..... well they taste like they came out of a freezer. The toppings just slide off and the crust is curiously shaped into a PERFECT circle. That tells me a machine made it, and it tastes just like you'd expect machine made crust would. \n\nThen there's the coffee, it's OK, but it's nowhere near the level of latte you can grab at someplace like Giant or Lux. They serve you waffles with rock hard cold butter AND freezing syrup. Not cool. Burnt quiche that would have been otherwise delicious, and caprese salad with barely ANY basil?! I mean....\n\nI really do want them to last, I like having a place to walk to after work and grab a cold one. Hob Nobs peeps: pretty please, make your food yummier ASAP!"
Two,"Very disappointing. Hardly any wait, and now I know why. We went a couple years ago when it first opened and had great food, but it has really gone downhill.\n\nTHE FOOD: Biscuits and Gravy. The biscuits are listed as jalapeno, but there was no jalapeno flavor at all. The gravy was decent. The roasted potatoes were not cooked enough and were too raw to cut with a fork.\n\nThe Benedict with crab. Obviously canned crab meat, and the hollandaise had a day-glo orange look to it, almost as if it had been made with Tang. The hollandaise flavor was off as well. And again, the same with the potatoes.\n\nBelgian waffle. Decent. It's kind of hard to screw up a waffle. \n\nSERVICE: The service was good. Attentive without being annoying.\n\nIt is definitely a place where the annoying of Scottsdale seem to flock to. I was expecting to see cameras come in to film an episode of Real Housewives of Scottsdale.\n\nWe won't be back."

Four,"For the last twenty years, I've enjoyed Long Wong's...from the one near Phoenix College to the one in Chandler (and in between).  Some are long gone and some remain, and some serve great wings and some not so great.\n\nA few Mondays ago, my craving for wings put me in a zombie-state....must have.  Now, living in S. Scottsdale, my choices are pretty limited.  Go to a sports bar or restaurant and pay 9 bones a dozen plus tip, grab sum from a deli at a grocery store (no thanks) or make THE trip.  Pssst...Scottsdale's LW is closed on Mondays.  :(  \n\nTen minutes later, I found myself at Long Wong's.  Basking in cold air amidst the Americana decor, I struggled whether to order Hot or Suicide...ya see, this wing joint actually makes a suicide sauce that rawks.  The Suicide allows me to actually savor the taste of the wings while bringing a tear (or two) to my eye...rare.\n\nWaiting for my order, the presence of several families iced it as a family-oriented place...ya can't beat the prices or quality of the kids meals.  About 8 minutes later, I was walking out the door with two dozen wings and an order of breaded zucchini.  \n\nFifteen minutes later, the little lady and I were enjoying wings and still crisp zucchini (thick cut with a golden batter) over a Cary Grant flick, His Girl Friday. \n\nFor medium-sized wings that taste great at a great price, this LW location is a keeper."
Five,Went on Friday night with a friend for dinner.  Ordered lemonade.  It was interesting but I wouldn't order it again.  Something about the rose water in it did not make it refreshing.  Then came out the babganouj and pita bread- just okay not nearly the best I've ever had.  It wasn't garlicky enough for my tastes.  Next was the lentil soup.  Oh.  My.  Gosh this was by far the best tasting soup I have had in my ENTIRE LIFE.  I will crave this constantly until I can return to have it again.  The thin little noodles and the yummy flavor in it.  yum!!  Next I had a falafel sandwich.  Was very good and well worth the less than $5 it cost.  I couldn't even finish it.\n\nI highly recommend eating here but you must order lentil soup!!
Two,"I've been here three times because it's close to home. I really don't like this yogurt shop compared to the others nearby. At issue are the blandness in taste and the extremely fast melting time of the yogurt. The variety of flavors and toppings are the same in quantity and selection as any other shop, but when my frozen dessert is not just plain-tasting but also completely melted when I'm only two thirds to three quarters done I get a little bit miffed."
Three,"Rolling Hills is two executive courses, and great for a quick cheap round of golf.  Totally not an out of towner destination course, but a nice little local fave of mine.  The front nine is the old course, and is a bit like mini-golfing, a fun distraction.  You even get to hear the occasional strange animal sound from the zoo hidden behind the trees along a couple holes.  The back nine is a newer build, and is way more challenging and scenic.  Either way they both give a fantastic view of the valley, and it's a great place to play a quick 9 holes after work in just over an hour\n\nOnly eaten at the clubhouse once, but both me and my bud liked our burgers, and it sits next to the 9th green, which is great for a little free entertainment."
Two,"Back in the mid-Nineties, studio-apartment-dwelling, student-loan-burdened me would come here and get great deals on things like Ecco shoes, Kenneth Cole shirts, fashionable jeans, and other things I never could have afforded new from Nordstrom's. Sometimes the condition was questionable, but the price always reflected that. I wore out several pairs of high-line shoes purchased here for $11-$12. \n\nThose days are long gone. Now, can't find a pair of shoes here for less than $30. The clothes are picked over. And mainly, going there is an opportunity for me to  bump into the future ex-Mrs. Bill B., or perhaps the exit strategy from the current prospective Mrs. Bill B. \n\nBecause If you're looking for young or not-quite-so-young-anymore shoppers in 5-inch heels, miniskirts and too much make-up, this is a great place to find them.\n\nJust don't offer to buy them shoes. Anymore. These days."
Three,Really good food. The place is hidden in a strip mall and it's pretty small inside but the menus and decor are really cute. Excellent service.  My friend inhaled his pad thai which he said was really good. I got something similar to drunken noodles and it was so good and the beef was super tender. My hubby got noodles too and asked for them thai extra hot and boy did he regret that! It lit him on fire. I'll have to try the curry next time.
Four,"Thank you Yelp reviews!  I would have never given this place a glance set back in the corner of a strip center - what a find!  It's a regular lunch stop now - I'll never be able to enjoy Chipotle again!\n\nExcellent burritos at an equally excellent price - I'm working my way through the menu.  Everyone that works there is very nice, salsas are excellent, and a great patio to sit outside and not feel like your in a parking lot."
Five,"What a dream come true to traipse into this store with my toddler girl and my husband. The store is filled, ceiling to floor, with all varieties of toys for all age groups. Shelves upon shelves of brands and models you've likely never seen if your main toy-shopping stomping grounds are Toys R Us or Walmart. The store's management clearly has a relaxed attitude about children playing in the store -- toys are sprawled across the store,  ready for the next child's little hands. Yet, it didn't feel messy in there. The aisles are wide and smooth. The store is organized into various zones. (Dolls, science, blocks, books, baby, etc.)  This is an absolute oasis in suburbia land where you're always hard-pressed to find non-chain stores."
Four,"Love this Mexican food for a dinner out on the weekends,\nMy husband LOVES hot and they have hot and I like it mild and they have that as well the green chilis are so good I cant even explain to you how good they are.\n\nReal authentic food and not a bad price for good food.\nWe have five kids under eight and they all love it here lots of food for a small price. The girls favorite is they order a large home made pizza size tortilla with a ton of cheese on it it comes on a metal pizza pan thats how large it is\n\nI think the only issue I do have is they charge for a second basket of chips for $2.95 but were not talking just plain chips and salsa they bring out a basket of chips with \n2 salsas, a bean dip, and a jalapeno ranch dip which is HOT but so good you cant stop eating it..so have plenty of water on the table before you start LOL"
Five,"Words cannot begin to describe the glory that is this fine establishment. Never had bad service or a bad meal. These puff pastry stuffed bundles of heaven erupt with surgically precise flavor combinations that leave me speechless every single time. \n\nMy new favorite is the Lamb & Mint, a delicious combination of succulent and juicy lamb, perfectly sliced potatoes, rutabaga, and of course, the fresh mint sprigs make for a truly transcendental dining experience. \n\nAfter tasting more than 3/4 of their menu, I have yet to taste a single thing that wasn't perfectly cooked, perfectly spiced, or perfectly paired with their exquisite red wine gravy. I could drink that delicious concoction by the gallon. \n\nThe vegetarian pasties are undeniably good as well, the Eggplant Parmesan is a worldly experience that I could eat any time, any day. It stuffs the best bits of the garden into a mozzarella, marinara and Parmesan wrapped envelope of goodness that has to be tasted to be appreciated.\n\nThe Cream of Leek, Potato and Stilton Cheese soup is out of this world, the Garlic & Herb Roasted Red Mashed Potatoes with Cheese make all other mashed potato dishes taste like dehydrated flake garbage, and the desserts (if you can find any more room in your belly for awesome) are the food of gods. The PB&J Pasty or the Banoffee Pie make me want to live in this restaurant until the day I die.\n\nThe location is being renovated currently to expand into the adjacent building, which is a welcomed change as the intimate dining area admittedly cramped on busy days. Though it is a wondrous experience to watch the staff prepare their pasties mere feet from your seat, it will really do well to have a few more tables. Sit at the bar if at all possible for the best dining experience.\n\nI wish I could give CPC 6 stars simply because the other places I've deemed worthy of 5 stars simply cannot compare. On top of all this, the unparalleled drinking specials, 32 oz steins, and $3 car bombs every day make this not only a wonderful place to eat, but a perfect spot to pickle the liver as well."
Four,"I went here yesterday for lunch with my Dad. The place was hopping!! There was a 20-40 minute wait, but, luckily, we found two seats at the bar. The restaurant is cute and the bar was a nice area. We ordered the steak panzanella (sp?) salad and the pepperoni pizza. Both were very good! I liked the steak in the salad, it was cooked to around medium I'd say and sliced thin, it was very tender and tasty. The dressing was great and the salad was fresh. The pizza was also very good, although a bit greasy. The pepperonis were the size of small saucers... which was awesome! They were perfectly spiced. The whole pizza had a lot of flavor, and I liked how the pepperoni came with basil on it. The sauce was also flavorful and delicious. I thought the place was fairly expensive, but I would definitely come back here again. And I have leftovers to eat today... woot!!!"
Four,"Really good atmosphere, and the staff was surprisingly cordial and welcoming.  One of the wait staff came over, while we were waiting for our table, and asked us if we wanted something from the bar.  We were seated shortly after having our drinks hand delivered.\n\nWe both ordered the ribeye entree, after hearing great reviews from a coworker.\n\nThe accompanying smashed potatoes were crispy on the outside, soft & tender on the inside. Perfectly salted and parmesaned (can you use cheese as an adjective?).\n\nBig stalks of broccoli, buttered, but undercooked, almost raw.\n\nBlack & blue coleslaw was very good. If you like blue cheese then you'll love this. Looking forward to trying it on a pulled pork sandwich.\n\nTheir ribeye was bursting with flavor. Tender & juicy. NOT what you'd expect from a neighborhood sports grill. The flavor rivaled Houston's. I can't say enough good things about it. We ordered it medium-rare, more on the rare side.\n\nThe manager came to check on us twice.  Once when we had to return my wife's steak, as it was overcooked.  He was very accommodating and had the replacement out in record time.  With steak, sometimes this happens, but it is how you remedy the situation that makes for a great experience.\n\nI highly recommend Blue 32."
Four,"Stayed here this past weekend while visiting Phoenix with my boyfriend. Rooms were very clean & pretty modern (except for the dated wallpaper). I think the hotel's located about 10 minutes from downtown Phoenix.\n\nSuite had:\n- Small counter w/a microwave, mini-fridge (actual fridge, not a mini-bar fridge, so you can store your own beverages in it), 2-cup coffeemaker (with coffee, tea, Half&Half creamers & sweeteners) & a teeny-tiny sink\n- Living room w/leather couch & fabric armchair, kind of flimsy coffee table & a flatscreen TV (Note: Remote was reaaaaally annoying to use b/c there was a 2-3 second delay each time you changed the channel)\n- Bedroom w/very comfy King bed, nightstands w/an alarm clock on one, a dresser & another flatscreen TV\n- Very clean bathroom, with 2 doors: 1 leading to living room, 1 leading to bedroom. Oh & must mention that this is also where the closet is. Yes, you read that right: The closet is in ... the bathroom. Huh?? (Closet had ironing board, hangers)\n\nEveryone at the hotel was very nice & accommodating, I was always met with courtesy & top-notch customer service everywhere (Front desk, lobby shop, bar/grill, valet, etc).\n\nHotel also had a lobby store (which sells beer & wine, for anyone who'd prefer to have a quick drink or 2 in their room without hitting up a bar), a lobby bar & restaurant, an indoor pool (which I didn't get to try out because I forgot to bring my bikini with me).\n\nMy only complaints (really minor):\n- Good yet Cheap Eats: Only place to eat at the hotel (without driving somewhere) was the hotel restaurant. Wasn't very happy with paying $15-$20 for mediocre (but edible) food each time I wanted to get a quick bite to eat. The lobby store had some snacks & Cup o Noodles, but that's about it.\n- Noise: Since the rooms face the atrium of the hotel, noise sometimes traveled up from the bar area & I was able to hear some loud laughter constantly at night. It wasn't crazy loud & didn't keep me up, but even from the bedroom, I was able to hear it a little. I guess my own stupidity was that I didn't shut the bedroom door, but I guess the comfy bed made me too lazy to do so.\n- Parking: Is $11/day, which luckily my man & I were exempt from due to a special deal he booked.\n- Elevators: Only 2 out of the 3 seemed to be working, for the most part they ran ok, but sometimes were a bit slow so there was sometimes a line of people waiting in the lobby for it.\n- A/C: It was kind of on the cold side in the room, even though I kept raising the temperature, it kept blowing out cool air.\n- No Safe: Didn't see a safe in the Bathroom Closet (feels weird saying that! haha).\n\nOverall though, would definitely stay here again!"
Three,"""I went here on a cold night around the holidays and it provided the warmth I needed. The front room is pretty hokey, and I'm not sure I'd like dining in there. But the back room, the \lounge\"""" area, is much more my style. The food was above average Mexican, lacking the spiciness of other spots but more than making up with the quality ingredients. I also enjoyed the live entertainment (some acoustic dudes covered \""""My Winding Wheel\"""" by Ryan Adams -- play that anywhere and I'll give three stars). I'd go back, but only for that back room.

REAL. GOOD. BURGERS. \n\nI had the Arizona Smash Burger: Chipotle bun, sauce, guac jalapenos and habanero cheese with a side of Smash fries (fries with olive oil and rosemary).\n\nThe burger was delicious. I enjoyed the spice but definitely could have used some hot sauce too. The hamburger reminds me of a good backyard bbq. The fries, eh- I could prob do without. However, I did get to taste some of my friend's onion rings (well, they aren't really rings, more like thinly sliced onions, battered and deep fried) and they were awesome.

Four,"Yes, I am the duke of BS west (at the time of writing).\nNo, I do not currently live in Scottsdale (or Arizona for that matter).\nYes, I think this place is a solid 4-stars!\n\nLet me explain what's amazing about this place in reference to the bars in San Francisco: \n\n1. 2 for 1 drinks Wednesday and Saturdays ALL NIGHT. Yea, shut the loose hole! This is an amazing deal! Our happy hour specials are 2-4-1 until 8 or 9, if we're lucky! \n\n2.

The bar tenders make 'em strong (especially the gal towards the smoking patio). \n\n4. 2 smoking patios?! NOICE. Many bars in SF require you to go outside!.. it just becomes a pain.\n\n5. They accept card. In the event you didn't know this, many places in SF don't.... \n\nYou may be a local and hate this place for what it is, but for someone who spends extended amount of time in the area every so often, I find it a great place to be near fagily (fag family)."
Three,"I really enjoyed the atmosphere of Carlsbad Tavern.  We chose to sit outside where it was cool and isolated from the rest of Scottsdale, although the inside looked cozy and inviting.\n\nOur service was great as well, unobtrusive yet on the ball.  Our iced teas were refilled quickly and our waitress always seemed to be right there when we needed her without hovering.\n\nBut the food wasn't that impressive.  It wasn't bad, and I probably made a bad menu choice: I ordered a steak at a place specializing in New Mexican cuisine.  For $21 I expected a steak of a bit higher quality than what I received.  It was difficult to cut and had none of the grilled flavor that I was anticipating, but it was smothered in a decent creamy peppercorn-laden sauce.  However, the mashed potatoes and veggies were great. The potatoes were loosely mashed with good amount of spice added that was noticeable but not overwhelming.  The veggies were a nice variety and not overcooked.\n\nAgain, the food wasn't bad, but not as good as I was expecting for the price.  I would go back for one of the menu items that is more in line for a restaurant specializing in New Mexican cuisine, but I'll go elsewhere when I've got a hankerin' for a good steak."
Two,Tried to pop into White Chocolate Grill the other night only to find an hour and a half wait.  Should have waited!  Instead we walked across the parking lot and found a cheap seafood chain that is actually worse than Red Lobster.  Please stay away as you will only be disappointed by their failure at every turn.  The only reason for the second star was that our server was actually quite funny.  We probably should have been able to guess the quality of food we were in store for when the Mahi Mahi was $9.
Four,"""The Vig Uptown is a textural dream. For me? This will definitely be a recurring one. Maybe it was the unique \cactus columns\"""" upon walking in or the herb garden to the left, but there is truly something charming and down to earth about the new Vig location.\n\nDo some research and modern enthusiasts will quickly find that the remodel of The Vig Uptown was originally Ralph Haver's AIA Award winning 1961 Arizona Bank building. Sweet....\n\nThe Vig's food is pretty good.

Five,"I am so happy I got to try this place. I must have been living under a rock because I had never really heard of Cibo much before, but wow. I cannot wait to go back now!\n\nThe atmosphere is just perfect. Our part actually sat outside, which the patio is just beautiful on a AZ October night. I didn't even feel like I was sitting in Phoenix. The restaurant is in a cute historic house and the patio is filled with older trees and plenty of plant life. There was even a cute little white cat running around. I felt like I was sitting in someone's grandma's garden. Someone's grandma who makes kick as freaking food.\n\nFor dinner, my party of three of us split the 3 Pair Bruschetta. The waiter made it sound like it was going to be small, but it's not. These are three GOOD sized pieces of bruschetta topped with a ton of toppings. I really enjoyed the Prosciutto one. Melt in your mouth good. Then we split the De Notte pizza. It was a white pizza with spicy salami, mozzarella and tomatoes. The top of the pizza was burnt just enough to give it that perfect flavor. I don't remember the last time, if ever I had a pizza THAT good. I was a little disappointed we didn't get to try a red pizza, but we were plenty full from the appetizer and main entree. Not too full to split a nutella crepe topped with vanilla ice cream..oh yeah baby, can't go wrong with a little nutella in your mouth. That's what she said.\n\nService was great. Our waiter was quick, despite how busy the place was. He was very friendly and very helpful, except for telling us the brushetta was small not that I'm complaining :). And I think the price was very right. I couldn't believe how inexpensive dinner was for 3 people and all the food plus drinks we had. Very reasonable. I plan on taking the husband there soon!"

In fact, on this trip, I took several boxes of stuff and while we wandered the thrift shop, it was already being unpacked in the back.  Not sitting in the box for the next 3 months.  So, some good stuff here and some not so good stuff like any thrift shop, and prices are appropriate.  As I understand, they also have an eBay store where donations of more substantial value are auctioned.  And I love that this shop has a pretty large pet section where you can buy food, supplies, and toys (all new) at a decent savings.  Great for people who need the savings and for those who would rather pay the Humane Society for a new collar rather than Walmart.  I do wish they had a pick up service, however, for large donations.  But I understand it's costly.\n\nSuch a great cause that I think I'll go through my husband's stuff and downsize him!"""""""
Five,"""I used to frequent another locally owned Tempe coffee shop to get my work done during the day and to visit with friends in the evenings, but between good coffee drinks and a perfect laid back atmosphere OSP has definitely won me over. They don't pressure you to buy something, the owners simply welcome you in and are excited to share their vision for OSP to be a fun, collaborative workspace. They're passionate about what they're doing and it really shows. \n\n... but even though they don't have a \one drink minimum\"""" to use their internet or to hang out there, you should get a drink anyhow. Seriously. My favorite is definitely the soy iced chai - super smooth and great flavor, though I guess that could be said about their espresso as well :) \n\nThe location was a little tough for me to find at first - it's in a plaza tucked away on the south side on University between McClintock and Dorsey, but it should be much easier to find once they get a real sign out front!"""""""
Four,I've only been here once and both my husband and I were surprised at how good the food happened to be. We didn't actually eat there..We sat at the bar and waited for our food and then took the food home. We were both surprised at how large the menu was and we had a hard time picking out what we wanted to try. We we got home and dug in the food was great and we were NOT disappointed.
Four,"This downtown Phoenix Hooters has become a comfort spot for me and my wife. We know we can always rely on friendly service, $5 32oz drafts served in ice cold mugs, delicious fried pickle slices and slightly above-mediocre oysters. The wings are pretty good too, but they go a bit overboard on the breading. \n\nWe came here a lot last fall/winter to catch football and hockey games due to our lacking of a television in our house. Basically any sporting event you can imagine will be playing on one of their many flat screens!"
Three,"""I generally enjoy the Cheesecake Factory; I hope this experience turns out to be a \one off.\""""  \n\nThe waiter \""""Mike\"""" was very good, attentive, \""""on top of things.\""""  The appetizers were Corn Fritters (very good), Fried Zucchini (very good but not much on the plate), and Artichoke and Spinach dip, (tasty but very, very oily). \n\nThe others ordered Burgers, Salads, Orange Chicken....all generally pleased.\n\nMy dinner was the Shepard's Pie, very large plate with a large circular dollop of mashed potatoes on top. It looked great....one bite later and all I could taste was \""""cumin.\""""  So overpowering I couldn't eat it.\n\nIt seems that seasonings come into vogue and pass from the scene every year. \nIn this case, the current spice of the month, quarter, perhaps year is \""""cumin,\"""" a spice which does wonders in minute quantities, and is ruinous in large doses. \n\nUnfortunately, the cook at the Scottsdale Cheesecake Factory uses a ruinous amount in the Shepard's Pie. \n\nI decided that while I waited for Mike to return to the table I'd eat the mashed potatoes from the the top of the Shepard's Pie....wrong; too salty to eat. If the person who made the mashed potatoes couldn't taste the salt long before it reached that level, there is something seriously wrong with their taste buds; combined with the overwhelming amount of cumin in the Shepard's Pie ( a dish not known for its \""""cumin like\"""" qualities) it leaves you wondering how this person got into a cooking position.\n\nBack to Mike....he was ready to make it right...took an order for something else, stayed with it to ensure I got my replacement meal quickly an in general took excellent care of a table of 5 like a pro."""""""
Four,"The food is FABULOUS.  The service SUCKED.  Capital S SUCKED.\n\nMy friends and I had been dying to try this place.  We met last night, and started with a drink at the bar.  They had cocktails, and I had a glass of white sangria -- it was pretty good, not fantastic.  The bartender was really nice, and pretty darn cute too (this wasn't the Scottish guy -- which I was sort of hoping to see -- I'm a total sucker for the accent).\n\nWe ordered the guacamole, which is truly divine.  Chunky, with a good amount of cilantro.  It comes on a bed of cabbage and some a radishes.  My friends thought that was kind of weird, but I thought it was good!  The chips were good, and they came with these weird sort of pinwheel-y things.  I didn't care for them, but my friends liked them.\n\nWe decided to get a few things for dinner and just share them.  We moved from the bar to our table and ordered the seafood tacos.  They were spectacular!  The fish and shrimp were tender and delicious.  We all raved!\n\nNext, we got the carnitas.  The pork was so delicious.  It had a lot of carmelized bits, which are of course my favorite part.  There was a bit of fat on it, which I had to pull off....  Blech.....  But it was so good, I didn't mind the fat removal.  They were served with black beans and rice or veggies and corn tortillas.  I would absolutely recommend this to anybody.  \n\nIt was around this time that the service REALLY got annoying.  The server and bussers kept coming by to see what they could clear from the table.  Literally they came by THREE times in ten minutes.  And it's not as if there was a huge queue at the hostess stand, and there were a few open tables.  So why the pushiness?  Did they NOT want us to stay and order more drinks?  Apparently not.  \n\nMy friend really wanted to try the green chile tamales.  So she ordered those, and they were good, but I was in no way WOWED.  After bringing those out, they came by again another two times to clear.  Finally we just gave in and told them to clear the table!  Fine ya bastards, take our plates!\n\nAnother point to make -- the food came out incredibly quickly -- which was nice at FIRST, but after the pushiness of the server and bussers, it just made us feel like they were trying to turn the tables and just get us out of there.\n\nI will definitely come back because the food was delicious.  My friends and I all commented about how interesting their menu was -- there were many different things we all hoped to try in the future.  Maybe last night's pushiness was a fluke.  I hope the next time I don't feel so much pressure to leave!"
Four,"Now that it's cooling down, I'll be heading back to Maizie's!   Summertime heat practically requires eating inside where it is just way too cramped and noisy (all those hard surfaces reflect every little sound).  But the patio is oh so lovely in the fall, winter and spring!   Love the Tuesday night pizza specials, the stuffed burgers, sweet potato fries, and every dessert I've tried has been superb (and even a bit too large!)   Service is always friendly and prompt, water glasses always refilled, happy hour specials are a great deal, large and tasty!    Like them on Facebook and get (seemingly) daily updates on specials!   Love Maizie's!"
Four,"This restaurant reminds more of Hong Kong (where I lived for a couple of years as a college exchange student many years ago) than any place in Arizona.  The atmosphere is definitely not upscale (more like some of the Long Wongs in PHX), and may be a bit of a culture shock to some, which is why I don't recommend it for everyone (4 instead of 5 stars).  The food, however, is very authentic, though they don't always have the exact ingredients that you would find in Hong Kong.  The dry flat rice noodles (ho fun) is among my all-time favorite Hong Kong dishes, and this place does it right. The clay pot dishes are also worth a try - really good. (Among the Chinese restaurants that I have tried in Phoenix, the Gourmet House of Hong Kong is #2.  Number 1 is the Great Wall, which I review elsewhere.)"
Two,"I went there the other night for dinner.  Granted, I was there early but other than two people sitting talking in the restaurant, there was nobody there.   I ordered a Chicken Arepa, Shredded Beef Empanada, and the Ground Beef Pastelito.   The kid who took my order behind the counter said it would take 15 to 20 minutes.  I couldn't figure out why it would take so long-maybe they had a lot of take out orders for pizza (they share the same kitchen with Rosati's).  Instead of taking 15 to 20 minutes, I'm waiting there around 30 minutes, the kid has disappeared, and once in awhile, I see some other guys in the back.  They must know I am waiting, but not once does anyone come out and tell me that my order will be out shortly.  Finally, some other guy who looks like he could be the boss asks me what I ordered.  I tell him, and he brings out my bag, which seemed to have been sitting there for who knows how long.  It seemed hot so I left and did not complain.\n\nAs far as the food, never having had an Arepa before, I was not too impressed.  It was somewhat bland and it tasted like a taco.  The empanada was incredibly greasy.  The Pastelito was the best-the ground beef was tasty.\n\nI might go back and try some other items on their menu but they need to improve on their customer service especially when there is virtually no one in their restaurant."
Four,"La Paloma Mexican Grill is a little hole in the wall restaurant perhaps only the staff of St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center and surrounding office workers know about in, what I believe is, the Encanto Park neighborhood.\n\nDon't let La Paloma's exterior or existence in a small strip mall overwhelmed by a medical supply store keep you from checking this great restaurant.\n\nLa Paloma is clean, the atmosphere friendly and the meals fresh, traditional and tasty. You order at the counter, then sit down to eat. For a Mexican restaurant, they have the typical dishes: Burritos, tacos, enchiladas, rice and beans.\n\nThe surprise here is the small section of the menu devoted to Korean cuisine. The owners are Korean, thus have to have dishes of their native land. My husband had their Beef Bulgogi, which is Korean beef barbecue with fresh vegetables and rice and loved it. \n\nCraving guacamole, I went for chicken tacos and a side of a guacamole with an interesting spice combination.\n\nThe only issue we had is that my meal arrived about 10 minutes before my husband's meal. It could be his dish took longer to prepare and they are used to the lunch crowd, which can have a casual attitude toward meal arrivals, If that makes sense. \n\nThey are open 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. weekdays and 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Saturdays. Closed Sundays.\n\nIf you find yourself in the area, or are curious about La Paloma, definitely check it out. We'll definitely go back there in the future."
Three,"First off I prefer Mariscos Sinaloa so we will continue to go there instead.\n\nI was a bit afraid to park my vehicle outside in this neighborhood with all the locals walking around.  The ambiance inside the restaurant was cute and enjoyable.  The server just had a flat affect.  He was neither friendly or rude.\n\nI thought the menu prices were a bit high.  We paid the full prices for lunch on a weekend.  We got plenty of free chips and the two salsas.  I really enjoyed the green one.  We did not receive any free tostadas like other yelpers report receiving.\n\nThe portion sizes were good and I left full with some leftovers.  My son is 12 years old and tried a half order of Oysters on the half shell.  It was his first time trying oysters and he really liked them.  I ordered a bean and cheese burrito, the cheese enchiladas and quacamole to share with my two little girls.  We really enjoyed the beans, the rice (and I am not usually a fan of rice!), and the guacamole.  The enchiladas were just okay."
Five,"""Oh wow I am super surprised this place only have a few reviews. This place is always packed with a line from it being so popular. CHARLIE\S TACO STAND!!\n\nThese are the BEST tacos I have had since I moved to Phoenix. I dont know how to explain how great they are. They meat is finely chopped up on top of a palm tree trunk which I am not sure if it give it a flavor to the meat but I think it does.

Four,"""Ate lunch here today while visiting my cousin Marc.  His wife Lori is a huge fan of this place.  She kept saying \fresh\"""" over & over again.  She was right.  It's a big room in a huge outdoor/strip mall kind of place.  You order off a menu that is painted on the wall, then you step up to a Subway Sandwich type counter where they prepare your food in front of you.  You order shrimp tacos, they throw the shrimp on the open stove right there.  Then they take your plate down the counter of \""""fresh\"""" ingredients and ask you want you want.  \nWhat kind of rice do you want?\nWhat kind of beans?\nWhich salsa?\nWhich reminds me: they have mango salsa!  Are you kidding me?  It was yummy. Did I mention they serve mexican beers?  They have margaritas too.  But they're pre-made and come out of a tap.  Which is the reason I'm not giving Bajio 5 stars\nThe place was seriously busy at lunch, but they have many tables."""""""
Four,"The gf and I both enjoy being active. We have some activities that overlap, but have trouble matching them up. Biking is fine, but my long legs prefer faster road bikes, where her not long legs goes towards enjoying the ride. She enjoys running, where I go tired of rolling my ankles every few miles. I enjoy racquetball, and she is afraid I will kill her with my long arms and deadly swing. Shooting some hoops is possible, but 1-on-1 is not probable.\n\nTennis! The gf has been taking tennis at the local community college and loving every minute of it. I played tennis back in high school and was in the winning pair in gym class. I just needed a racquet.\n\nEnter Sports Exchange. I had just been to Bookmans to trade in some CDs and books whose box hadn't been opened for some 8 years. I was on a high to the tune of $80 trade credit. On the way out of the parking lot, Sports Exchange caught my eye. Used sports gear? Yes!\n\nJust inside, the interior had the familiar look of most shops with used sports equipment. Maybe the lighting was dim, maybe the carpet was old, I don't recall exactly. I do recall being greeted by the owner. Kevin Alms was answering a few questions on boxing gloves. From what I overheard, the two guys (Father-son would be my guess) were looking for gloves for UFC fighting. Kevin told them the differences between the colors and asked a few questions about the intended use, and made some suggestions.\n\nWhen he checked in with me, I let him know I was looking for a tennis racquet. I told him I'd played racquetball and wanted to play tennis with my gf. He showed me the different types of racquets, one for power and one for accuracy. Not wanting to kill my tennis partner, I went for accuracy. I stumbled through the racks of racquets (no pun intended, I won't take credit for that), I asked if *this* was one he'd recommend. After getting my price range, he gathered a few racquets that fit my profile within my budget (there was also sale on tennis racquets). He pointed to one that he thought was the best, which I chose and he checked me out.\n\nI don't really like shopping unless I have a good idea of what I'm looking for. Kevin Alms at Sports Exchange made the selection process quick and it was a pleasant transaction, with advice I appreciated."
Four,"I go to this store when i need to stock up on my Asian cooking essentials. This store is huge and has food items from around the world, it's an international supermarket. Every aisle is labeled with the country that the food items originate from. I was like a little kid on a field trip during my first visit and just gawked at all the unique items in every aisle. The produce sections rocks. They have just about every kind of fruit and vegetable that exists and at very cheap prices and the quality is always fresh and good. They also have a very good seafood selection."

The chicken/asparagus/havarti sandwich almost killed my taste buds with its deliciousness.  i went for carry-out at a peak time (about 12:30) and TOTAL, from joining the 6-person line to walking out the door, I probably spent about 15 minutes there.  very fast service=very happy jenny.\n\ni didn't get dessert, but i will be back on a day when i'm feeling either very fit or very depressed.  maybe tomorrow, due to my 3 PM CLOSE TIME funk.  crimeny. \n:)"

Four,"Food City is your typical latino market..I grew up in Northern NJ, where we had a million littlle spots that looked just like this one.\nThe exception, is there is very little south american or carribbean labels..until now.\nI've had a hard time adjusting to food shopping in AZ-I've searched far and wide because most products are geared toward the Mexican population, which I totally get, but hey, there are other latinos out here too!\nI walk into Food City, and I'm totally overwhelmed with joy-they now carry most of the Goya line. For us east coast latinos...it's a blessing like you wouldn't believe. Sure, the prices are inflated compared to back east (why is nectar goya almost $2?!), but being able to buy them local vs having my relatives ship me boxes of Goya products is fantastic!! \nThank you Food City, for realizing other latinos need our Goya stuff :)"
Two,"This place has ok food and great wines but the chairs are extremely uncomfortable.  First off, we were unfortunate enough to get a table with the stools with no backs.  So, there was no lounging in a relaxed posture while enjoying our wine.  Secondly, the stools were too high for the table which means you have to stoop down to eat in a very awkward way.  Third, they had live music.  The guitar player/singer was actually really good but they had a full amp and speaker system even though it is a pretty small place and so this made it very difficult to carry on a conversation with the other couple we were with.\n\nI didn't feel comfortable enough to eat a full dinner since the height made it difficult to use utensils so I just got appetizers.  The red pepper hummus was good but the plain one was not too good.  I also tried the potstickers - fun to try something different (they were made with crocodile meat) but nothing to write home about.  My husband got the Roo burger which he said had a good taste but a weird texture.  I also tried one of the bruschetta pieces that someone else in our party had ordered.  I love brie but this one was nothing really special.  They had a variety of bruschetta options but they were pretty much the same options that have become trendy with all the wine bars in the valley that I have been to.  I think the best part of the meal was actually the sweet potato fries that came with my husband's burger.  These were really, really good.\n\nTwo of us also got the evening's tasting flight.  All the wines we sampled were very good.  However, you only got four two oz pours for $20.  I noticed the prices were very good during Happy Hour so I would consider going back for that but I don't think I could take those horrible chairs after working a full day at work.  I won't be back unless they get new furniture."

I must presume that they were not purposefully trying to kill me, so it has to be that the staff and the kitchen just can't keep track of it all. Don't forget that there are one thousand effing ingredients in play in each diner's meal, let alone that it says bloody CORN ALLERGY all over the effing ticket! I trusted you, Chef, and you disappointed me. And you didn't even come out yourself to take responsibility for it, you jerk!\n\nUnfortunately I could not enjoy any of the courses which followed. I was just too damn paranoid. I gave up and asked for the corny check.\n\nEPILOGUE\nI hope you can believe me when I say that I have been _dreading_ this review for weeks. It could be that my experience was just a fluke. My story is but a single snapshot. Who am I to pass judgment on such elegant art?

Two,"""Discovered via Groupon and ordered after checking reviews on Yelp. 2 stars are for the great pizza and unique variety of pizza toppings. Ribeye and blue cheese? Yes, please. Great crust and good enough sauce to get the job done. Bringing the rating down were two things. The \hot\"""" wings were overcooked, though the sauce was flavorful. Sign of an amateur chef or maybe just a bad day. In keeping w/ the bad day as a possible excuse is the owner Frank. When I informed him he was overcharging customers who order pizzas 1/2 and 1/2 w/ ingredients, I experienced one of the oddest exchanges I've had w/ any place of business. Long story short, he said I was the first person to ever notice (how long had they been overcharging ppl??), invited me to train his staff or open my own business for 2.5 milllion to run it how I want, said he'd never lost a customer over a few bucks and w/ obvious great pain offered a small credit - not even the correct amount. Wow. So I learned Frank and math aren't best friends and he can no longer say he didn't lose a customer over a few bucks (there's 2 now). So many great places to get pizza.

Three,"I suppose if there is one benefit to being single and typically eating alone, it is that you can try new, perhaps more obscure restaurants without worrying about poisoning your date. For lunch I set out to find a restaurant on McDowell. The neighborhood looked a little sketchy and the parking was minimal. I pulled in a lot which turned out to be the incorrect parking for the place I was visiting. Maybe it was a sign because the other place appeared to be closed, so I headed back toward the car and noticed I was in the parking lot for The Gourmet House of Hong Kong. I was hungry and I like Chinese, so why not? \n\nThe place didn't look that big on the outside, but it was very spacious inside. You walk in through the kitchen and the staff takes you into a large dining room. I also liked the chairs- a wooden chair with a cut-out design of a steaming cup of coffee...or maybe that is hot tea...either way it was cool. Speaking of large, the menu was expansive. A lunch time menu had a good selection of food for about $4.50 each. The regular menu was over 10 pages and as I flipped through and saw squid, live lobster, duck, frog legs and other things I didn't want, I became worried again that it might in fact be more than I hoped for.\n\nI settled with the Kung Pao Chicken which came with steam rice. I added egg drop soup and the waitress asked if I wanted an egg roll. I then bumped up to the lunch plate that included the entr\u00e9e, rice, egg roll and to my surprise a hidden fried rangoon. The soup came out almost immediately. First sight told me this was a hearty soup - I took a sample and YUM! Good broth, good egg and a ton of veggies - celery, mushrooms, onion and snow peas filled the bowl making it filling even for a small. \n\nThe food came less than 5 minutes later. The Kung Pao was loaded down with onions, green peppers and lots of peanuts. The sauce was sweet and not overpowering, but there was a subtle kick to it. The egg roll was good, as was the sweet and sour sauce. The mustard sauce was very strong and one taste opened my nostrils. The total was $6.08 for the plate, $1.69 for the small soup. \n\nI stumbled upon this place by accident, but I am glad I found it. That and the sign on the inside proclaiming an award for Best Chinese by New Times Magazine (couldn't see the year) said I will be back next time I am looking for some Chinese close to the office."
Five,"Defalco's is one of my favorite lunch spots. I read the reviews that talk about the lines, I have to tell you I never saw them as that bad. Sure, you have to wait a few minutes, but it generally works out ok. One item not mentioned thus far, an item not on the menu but something they'll make any time is the Portabello mushroom sandwich. The grocery items seem expensive, but the sandwiches are completely reasonable\n\n\nI'm not sure how they are doing right now with the tomato scare, but I know I'll be visiting Defalco's again soon."
Five,"I've been there twice and both times I was surprised at how good it was.  The first time I had the falafel sandwich and it was fried perfectly crisp on the outside and bursting with flavor on the inside.  The second time I had the gyro platter, which is a mound of shaved gyro meat, pita wedges, jasmine rice and a Greek salad.  It was all great, right down to the Tzatziki You might balk at $9 but it's a huge meal, definitely worth it.  I also suggest the flavored iced teas that they have.  Really, it was all amazing.  You could pick this place up and put it in any city and it would fit right in."
Two,"I had heard about this great Mexican restaurant called Filiberto's. Some of my friends seemed to talk endlessly about how good of drunk food they have. Last night, I was totally sober and looking for some quick food while on a short break from work. I recalled this location and my friends' words that it had great food. I sort of forgot they said 'drunk' food. \n\nI ordered an enchilada and burrito combo. I really don't know what to say about them besides it was remarkably unremarkable. I am not much of a cook myself but I felt that I could have made the same exact meal with minimal effort, possibly even make it better.\n\nI doubt I'll ever go here again. If I do, I will make sure to be at least slightly intoxicated. Maybe the food will taste better then."
Three,"I stayed here for graduation in early May and some of my family stayed here as well. Since my boyfriend and I arrived before everyone else we were fine with the room we were given - full kitchen, adequate space, nice layout - until we saw what my stepfathers room looked like! He was paying the same price (yelp escapes 50% off) and his room was spectacular!! All new furniture, huge flatscreen, brand new bedding! \nWhy did we get the room with the tiny old school tv and mis-matching bedding and pay the same price!? They were renovating the units next to ours and bringing in new furniture and Tvs while we were there, and they could not have fixed ours before we got there!? \nThat being said, the resort was adequate, it was nice; but it DOES NOT LOOK ANYTHING LIKE IT LOOKS ON THE WEBSITE! The pool area is smaller and there is no lounge area (that we saw) and there is still renovations going on. Also, it is an old apartment complex, so don't be surprised when you pull up!"
Four,Was in Phoenix for a softball tournament this past weekend and stayed here cause it was one of the host hotels for the tournament.  \n\nFront desk staff were friendly and fast so check in was a breeze.  The room was great. Had 2 double beds in a separate room and a queen size pull out. Beds were comfortable and linens were above normal hotel quality. Bathroom was big...though it contained the closet which was kinda weird. Towels were over sized and very soft. Small balcony was nice.  Parking was in a structure next to the hotel and we never had a problem. Loved the atrium like interior of the hotel. \n\nThe only cons I can think of were\n...the elevators were kinda slow.\n...the toilet didn't flush right away and you had to hold the handle down a few seconds.\n...and the hash browns at the breakfast buffet were extremely dry hahaha\n\nOver all this hotel is a very nice one to stay at and I would definitely stay here again if I am ever in Phoenix again.
Two,"""It's difficult to rate the park itself.  I came here for the \Oktoberfest\"""".  I couldn't see much of the park because of all the booths.\n\nI can say that the \""""Oktoberfest\"""" was utter crap.  I've been to the real one in Munich.  This wasn't even close.  First, \""""Oktoberfest\"""" is not a carnival.  So what is with those stupid rides?  And when you get a beer, it's in a tiny (TINY!) cup.  The real deal you get a pint.  Sure, it's still over-priced even in Munich.  But at least they give you a decent quantity.  Also, the selection was a joke.  There was Warsteiner (probably the best of the choices), Bud (are you kidding me?), Beck's, and Shock Top.  That's it.  In Munich there are about a dozen halls (I didn't count), each featuring a different brewer.  Here they expected the crowds to get their beer at a counter, which made for huge congestion and crowding.  The proper way is to have everyone sit on the benches (at really long picnic tables) and a bar maid brings you what you want.  Much more efficient that way as there are only bar maids running around instead of hundreds of patrons.\n\nSeriously...the Tempe \""""Oktoberfest\"""" is a complete waste of time and money.  Will never go again.\n\nI suspect the park itself might be nice if it's not shoulder-to-shoulder full of people and booths selling junk food."""""""
One,"I booked a rental through Costco Travel.....\n\nthe line was extremely long( like waiting for a ride at Six Flags).\n\nIf you prefer to use a debit card, they will slap $200 dollars more on hold in your account and run a credit check. I think that it's the most ridiculous thing ever. \n\nI hate the fact that I didn't get to choose my car at their garage. A slip was given to me on where my rental is parked, and I had to get to it on my own; without any personal interaction if i had any questions about the vehicle. I didn't like the Ford Fiesta they rented out to me. The breaks were making some sounds....AND!!! it was cherry red. I didn't like a cherry red car.\n\nOther companies gave you options and are more personal. Some even pull the car up for you, and help you put your luggage in the trunk.\n\nI like to be treated like a princess.\n\nTheir insurance is also pretty expensive. I was shell shocked and for the very first time, i drove a rental without any form of insurance. Thank goodness, the car was alright. My damage: $152 for a 6day rental. Not bad."
Five,"In my first review, I indicated I would give this place another chance.  So glad I did!  After a concert Thursday night, we decided to stop in here for a late night drink.  It was pretty late, so not much of a crowd.  The lights were dim, the atmosphere was cozy, and I was happy to see an interesting tap selection.  I had some kind of pale ale by Anchor Steam, and it was yummy.  While I hadn't intended to eat anything, I saw the late night menu and had to try the hummus plate. Best part?  The sweet pickled baby cucumbers. Just like my mom makes!  Bartenders were knowledgable and attentive, crowd was mellow,  it was a romantic way to end our night out, and our last night for this trip to Scottsdale.  Couldn't have been better!"
Three,"The food at this place really only deserves two stars, but it's a decent enough restaurant to grab Mexican food with a large group while out in Scottsdale, so three stars it is... \n\nI used to come to this place every now and then with friends while living in Scottsdale, and we all agreed that it was mostly for convenience & the fact that the people who own the place are very nice. In other words we didn't come for great Mexican food,.. \n\nI came here recently with four other people (one of which was a child) while visiting Scottsdale. I ordered a combination plate with a green corn tamale, chile relleno, beans, and rice. The beans & rice were kind of bland, but not bad. The chile relleno & tamale were both covered in the same green sauce, which was also kind of bland. None of the food was bad, just bland. Actually, the chile relleno was pretty good (it was cheesy). \n\nThe group I was with ordered queso dip w/spinach as an appetizer, which was actually pretty good! I have to say the chips & salsa here are pretty damn tasty as well! \n\nThe service is friendly, but kind of slow and not very attentive (everyone who works here is nice though, so I guess they make up for there shortcoming by serving with kindness). It took us awhile to get drink refills, but the food came pretty quickly. One thing that I think is really nice here is that they will allow you to pay at the front counter if you need to divide up a bill. As far as pricing goes I actually think it's a little on the higher side for the quality and what you actually get, but it's not horrible. My meal was $13 or $14 and I did have leftovers. In terms of atmosphere, it's cheesy Mexican decor (that's not a good thing or a bad thing...it's just what it is). \n\nWhen I'm back in Scottsdale and want Mexican food I'm sure this place will get suggested. I won't be the one suggesting it, but I wouldn't be opposed to it if someone else did."
Five,"""I didn't know Chinese food THIS GOOD existed, especially in MESA!\n\nBeing a huge fan of Chinese food, I was very excited to try this place after the rave reviews I read on Yelp.  I was not disappointed!  This place serves up the best Chinese food in Arizona, easily..... and for CHEAP.  You would be hard pressed to find a dish over $7.\n\nDo yourself a favor when you get the menu and just skip the first three pages until you start seeing \Hong Kong Style xxxxxxxx\"""" and start there.  They have truly authentic Cantonese / Hong Kong style cuisine with dishes I have never seen anywhere else.  \n\nI have had probably 8 different items there so far and each one was AMAZING.   Try something out of the ordinary, you won't be disappointed.  Also, you have to try a Chow Fun dish.  It's a MUST.  I have never tasted Chow Fun as good as they have it.... it's crazy how good their Chow Fun is, no joke.\n\nTwo words of caution..... sometimes the English translation of the items is not exactly the same as the Chinese translation... obviously the chef uses the Chinese translation, so do yourself a favor and confirm the choice with the waitress.  For instance, their \""""Black Pepper Sauce Chow Fun\"""" is actually Chow Fun with Black Bean sauce with green peppers.  Not a big deal since everything is excellent, but just so you know.  Second word of caution.... you WILL get addicted to this food!  You have been warned.  :)"""""""
Five,"AMAZING PLACE!\n\nSo I went on a tour and I had no idea what to expect. Don't go on a tour in the summer because you don't get to see as much. They show you the olive trees outside and bring you inside but the press is not operating so they talk about things. I would RECOMMEND going during the Oct-Nov months when they do press. Call ahead of time and ask if they are so you can see it in action! Also, you sample olives during this tour (I was confused and I thought we sample olive oil).\n\nOlive oil samples are available in the facility without a tour. You can just sample whatever you want. You can also buy bread if you want to dip it in there. I thought it was weird just drinking from it but I got used to it. They have bunch of flavors of olive oil, including chocolate! It's weird but it's good. I love the freshness and crispness of the flavors. They do something right with their olive oil. The strawberry balsamic is good and I thought I could make strawberry balsamic but someone's doing something right (they don't make the vinegars though).\n\nThere's actually bunch of samples besides the olive oil. So when you enter the building, on the right, there's samples of other items too. Try those! \n\nI am not a coffee fan... but you can ask about how they grind their coffee beans and they'll show you. Also I am not a wine fan either but I came when there's wine tasting so you can wine taste as well. \n\n-- SO MANY freeee samples of delicious goodiesss! \n\nAlso if you're traveling from out of town (or out of the state) and you want to bring some olive oil back with you, bring a ice chest with ice. Also they deliver olive oil as well. The lady was SUPER helpful when we asked about delivery so inquire about that. Staff here is kind and amazing, they'll help you with your needs!"
Four,"When Bill Heard Chevrolet in Scottsdale went belly up a year ago I was forced to find a repair shop for my Chevy Blazer.  I have now been to the Car Repair Company three times for oil changes and am increasingly pleased with the service.  Every time I visited Bill Heard it was several hundred for this and several hundred for that.  \n\nCar Repair, on the other hand, does a thorough inspection and only seems to charge for what is necessary.  Today I spoke directly with the mechanic and he gave me a complete run down.  He reviewed my repair records and drove the car.  Last time I needed a new idler arm but this time it was good news with only a few minor things for next time.  He even thought I could drive across the country with the shape it was in.  Although I have no plans for a long road trip I felt like he was confident with the inspection.\n\nFour stars for now and wait and see how the summer goes..."
Three,"""Maybe my expectations were super high since El Chorro Lodge is like an Arizona institution, but after experiencing a meal at this restaurant, I can't bring myself to give more than three stars.  Don't get me wrong, it was \A-OK,\"""" it just didn't blow me away.\n\nThe history of this place dates back to the 1930's and is pretty amazing.  You can read about it on their website.  The outdoor dining area is huge and has great views of Camelback Mountain.  The live music provides for a nice ambiance as well... at least live music when we were there on a Saturday night.  And our meal got off to a nice start with the relish tray and sticky buns - yum!  But the service was really slow and the food was nothing to write home about.  We found it to be overpriced as well.\n\nI'd consider returning to El Chorro for brunch or lunch or drinks or just picking up sticky buns \""""to go\"""" sometime, but I wouldn't recommend it for dinner."""""""
Four,"We went here early on a weekday afternoon. We were seated in a comfy booth behind a quintet of cougars. They provided all the entertainment we needed, and it was quite sad when they were cut off at 5:15pm on a Tuesday afternoon. Once they were given the no-go to more booze all hell broke loose. They were literally escorted out kicking and screaming by 4 manager/security guys. I feel bad for the kids they were probably picking up at soccer practice later that night! \n\nWe had crab cakes, Miso Sea Bass, and a shrimp salad. The miso sea bass rivaled the one served at Nobu. It was so fabulous, something we weren't expecting. The salad was average and the crab cakes were served with a scrumptious citrus sauce! We were impressed with this chain and will be back!"
Five,"JJ and his team are true professionals. I needed a service and was having some trouble with fluid leaks under my truck. He determined it was a broken seal, called a dealership and arranged for me to get it fixed under the powertrain warranty. He saved me a lot of money and was very thorough in evaluating my vehicle. They also gave me a ride home and picked me up which was really nice. I am happy to have found a shop I can trust! Seems rare these days."
Five,"I had never tried Bikram yoga before and I had heard about this place and for new students, they offer 30 days for $30 of unlimited classes.  I loved it.  My husband and I started going together and he is the opposite of what yoga is, so when I was able to get him to 5 classes, I was amazed.  I also told some friends and they jumped on the bandwagon too.  It is an awesome way to sweat and believe me, you have never sweat like this before.  All the instructors are awesome.  Andrea, the owner, is amazing.  If only I could have her body.  What was great, was when you are in a relaxed state (for about 20 seconds) lying on your stomach, she will come by and step on your feet.  It's like a little foot massage.  Make sure you get to class about 15 minutes early so you can grab a good spot, bring plenty of water and be ready to sweat."
Four,"""Went for happy hour at 4 p.m. on a Wed.  The place was quiet but packed shortly after 5 p.m.  Drinks are $2 off and appetizers $3 off.  Don't get fooled by the fancy drink menu, it's cheaper to order a \regular\"""" drink, my large vodka martini was $5.\n\nWe shared the calamari, excellent, the spicy tuna roll, very good, and the potstickers, pretty good.\n\nIt's very dark and we had a table with no light above so it was very difficult to read the menu.  My only other complaint was that we had not finished the food but were asked no less than 10 times in about 15 minutes for them to clear our plates.  I know people were waiting for tables but we hadn't finished our drinks yet and were still grazing a bit.  We finally gave in and let them take it away.   Immediately three waiters scooped up everything and wiped off the table.  Get to hell out was the message."""""""
Four,"Cool atmosphere in a nice area of town - prices are pretty even with nicer sushi restaurants I've visited in any major city (in other words, a little higher than you'd typically see in a smaller town, or in a place with less attention to decor).\n\nMy friend and I shared several items, the hotty hamachi was the standout for me.  Great flavor, but not too much to overpower the fish. Seaweed salad was also good.  Can't remember the roll we had, but it was just okay.  Tuna nigiri was great, and the two orders of yellowtail nigiri we had were split - first one was great, second order wasn't as tasty (different fish I guess)."
One,"""Good lord, why can't this chain get much of anything at all right?\n\n1. When I order something for a time over the internet, I expect that the food I ordered will be ready at that time. Its been a long day, a busy day, and to have my food delayed 10 to 15 minutes past when I was scheduled is a major inconvenience. I order online versus going in and ordering to avoid people, hassle and wasting my time. Yet somehow this concept eludes them and my time is not of a priority to them. \n\n2. They put beef in the bottom of my girlfriend's dinner. Now with past girlfriends this might not have been an issue, but my special lady friend does not eat beef in any form. While this sucks for her, its more concerning to me. I have a massive and acute allergy to all fish products. If I would have eaten something that had a piece of fish or shrimp hiding in the bottom, I would have been direct to the hospital. As much as I might enjoy chain eatery Chinese food, its just not worth the risk for me to eat at a place that while touting \if you get it with veggies and tofu its going to be VEGETARIAN\"""" and then have them mistakenly put meat in the bottom.\n\nLong story short, if you have food allergies or if you're in a hurry, I'd skip this place. The food isn't good enough to venture the annoyances of dealing with this place."""""""
One,"US Airways lost my luggage. What was worse is that they lied to me and told me that it has made it to the East Coast from Europe, just to stop me from asking questions. They assured me that it was only one flight behind. 4 days later, it's still missing. If you're planning to have checked-in luggage, avoid US Airways at all cost. My sister also lost her luggage. They lied to her as well. Her bag was loaded on a different airline and traveled across Europe before getting it back several days later."
Two,"I've been to this location a few times now, and I guess it's time for me to write a review of this place.  Honestly, of all the grocery stores big and small here in the Valley, Trader Joes is probably my least favorite.  Over the years, I've tried to like them..trust me, I've TRIED. I just can't get into the Trader Joe's scene.\n\nIt's not one particular thing that turns me off about Trader Joe's, but maybe its a variety of small things that irk me. For starters, I find thier food selection odd.  Mostly prepackaged stuff, with no deli, meat counter,  and very little name brand stuff.  I know I know, I don't need to buy every single thing name brand, but there are some things name brand that I prefer over others.  Plus, when I buy lunch meat, I want to go to a Deli Counter and get it, which they do not have.  Just prepackaged meats n cheeses.\n\nI tend to buy mostly sandwiches here during lunch hour.  Their fair priced, and right there.  The first few times I went here, I was getting a Tuna Sandwich on whitebread.  I liked it, and started buying it on a regular basis.  Then, they stopped making it.  Why?  I dunno, but I haven't seen it in like 3 weeks.  Just when I start liking something, it vanishes.  Now all they have are tuna wraps, but they arent as good as the sandwiches.\n\nAs for grocery shopping on a weekly basis, I will probably never be a regular here.  The reason I frequent this Trader Joe's is because its A) close to my office, B) there's a decent sandwhich selection readily available, and C) thier staff is always friendly and helpful."
Five,"""Now that I'm living back in Central PHX I got a membership once again at Movies On Central. \n\nI love their selection and I can usually find that odd arty flick here that most other video stores don't carry. Just like this weekend I was searching for \Ladies and Gentleman Introducing The Fabulous Stains\"""" starring a teenage Diane Lane and Movies on Central had it! \n\nI like how they have a cult movie section and section off movies by director.\n\nIf you are a movie buff this store is for you."""""""

I seen this nail ssalon on Yelp and decided to treat myself and find a Salon I can keep coming back too.... Not only was this place Super small, but VERY UNSANITARY!!! When doing my pedicure they did not take out anything new out the package but pulled out a dirty box and used it on my feet. I looked around and seen NAIL DUST everywhere like they havent cleaned or wiped anything down in months or years!! I sat down to get my Nails filled and looked at the displays on the walls and cabinets filled with nail dust and fingernail clippings. Dirty walls.... I thought to myself NEVER AGAIN will I come back here. I sat down on the otherside of the room to dry my nails in the dryer and looked under the dryer and nail clippings and more nail dust inside the dryer! HOW DOES THAT WORK??? I aint never out of 15 years of getting my nails done seen a place this FILTHY!!! Can u say NAIL FUNGUS! DONT GO THERE!!!!"
One,"Thank you to Sarah L for bringing to my attention that the lunch menu from which I got my information about the $34 crab cake entree was for the NYC location. However, I did note that the crab cake appetizer at the Scottsdale location  - presumably a smaller portion than the lunch entree - is $16. Yes, yes. It is Barney's and I understand the premium pricing. What I question is how Fred's scored only $$. I often eat out with those on a tighter foodie budget than mine; the $$ is misleading, when Oregano's is also $$. Just sayin'."
Two,"Buyer Beware!!  Be prepared to drop more $$ than you anticipate with your local dine coupon.  The coupon was $50 for the four course big night out dinner for two.  What they don't tell you is it really costs $83 for this meal.  So.....we spent $25 on the coupon for $50.  You will pay the difference on this deal, plus drinks and they add a $20 tip on top of this (for you to cook your own dinner!!).  We felt totally ripped off when we got the bill for $79.63!  This is a VERY misleading coupon.  We have not had this problem with others from local dines.  Needless to say, we will not go back to the Melting Pot again, nor recommend this place.  Local Dines needs to be more specific with the coupons and what you are really getting.  Also we had a private booth which was nice and cozy, however the music was very loud and not anything we like to listen to (old torch songs), we asked them to turn down the volume three times and it was still too loud in our booth!!"
Four,"Fun atmosphere and very good service. We liked all of the sports memorabilia. Our server was very attentive, friendly, and patient. The busboys were also very attentive and friendly. We especially were glad to have been given good service even though we did not order any beverages (you'd be surprised at how many servers are rude to us after they discover that we won't be ordering alcohol).\n\nFood was good! We enjoyed: the bread, sweet and sour cabbage soup, caesar salad, baby back ribs, salmon, mashed potatoes, and creme brulee. The chopped liver at the beginning of the meal was also a nice bonus!\n\nOnly cons would be that the french fries were mundane. Also, we were a little confused about what was a part of the meal (sides, soups, etc), what was an upcharge, what we couldn't add, etc. It wasn't outlined on the menu, and our server had to explain a couple of times.\n\nThe manager came by after to ask how everything was. Very nice!"
Three,"So...I was in the mood for some boba today and decided, shoot, what the heck, I'll try some place new. Lollicup is a nice place, very clean and it has free wi-fi...always important. The owners were very friendly and service was very fast.\n\nThe drinks were good. Nothing extraordinary...I think it was pretty similar to Lee's and that other Boba place at Alma School and Elliot (forget what its called). I had the Almond Tea Milk...good flavor, lot's of Boba but not enough ice. It as all melted in like 5 minutes. I did, however, enjoy the really neato-nifty-Asian vacuumed sealed lids they put on top of the cups. Way cool.\n\nMy daughter got a Watermelon smoothie, which she drank a little of and then said she didn't like it. I tasted it, it wasn't bad. I think she was weirded out by the boba. It was her first experience with them and despite being 1/4 Korean, she wasn't too fond of them.\n\nI also ordered edamame because you have to have a bill of $10 to use a debit card (so if you don't order more than 3 drinks, make sure you have cash). Edamame was edamame...tasty as usual, but nothing special.\n\nI thought the drinks were a little pricey, but in the normal scope for those things.\n\nAll in all, a good experience. Not a place I'd go to every day, but a fun treat every once in awhile."
Three,"The menu is thoughtful and the house decor offers a cohesive gesture of casual. Tv's and charming booty butts everywhere, kinda like any given home that offers good food, tv and a honey combined for a gratifying result. \n\nMy stomach was rumbling this late morning so I ordered up the BLT with a fried egg and a side of sweet potato fries and water. A solid meal that came in at $8. I was in need of a relaxing moment to fuel up with a sentimental meal that would ease my mind and uplift my spirit. \n\nThe guys and gals delivered."
One,"""I stopped going to this location a few years ago after waiting 45 minutes in an empty dining room for a pizza.  I recently went bac after hearing there was new management. In my opinion things are worse.  There is a manager with reddish hair and a real red face (as if he was high on something) yelling at the servers very loudly .. and very unprofessionally.  Then the server came over to my table and he had a huge bump on his cheek.  Very unnerving. I ordered their Italian Beef Hero and a Pepsi.  Once again I waited too long for my sandwich.  When it came, it looked like they put  2 shaved slices of beef on the sandwich, this was not a \hero\"""" roll, yet it costs nearly $9.00 with tax.. After I paid for my meal and was leaving, a very tall and big man wearing a NYPD pizza tee shirt walked by me smelling like a cross between cigarettes and marijuana. I don't think I'll be going back there again.  Forget the quality of the food, the employees are scary enough."""""""
Four,"This place was the beginning of the end for me.  For those of you who know me, know what this means.  Otherwise, ignore that last comment.  \n\nI came here on a Wednesday night and the 2 for 1 deals totally killed me.  Not only were the drinks reasonably priced but they were reasonably poured.  Everything i had was in a pint glass.  How often do you get greyhounds in a a pint glass?  Needless to say after 3 drinks i was partying it up on the dance floor.  I love me some dance music!! They played Untouched by The Veronicas.  That song is all i need to make any night complete at a club.  There was also quite a bit of eye candy, even if my friend said all the uglies were out that night.  I really can't complain about this place, but this night turned out to be super awesome and memorable!"
Five,"Love! \n\nCibo is a place I have been wanting to go to for ages, and after getting lost and missing an event downtown, I decided to treat myself to dinner here. It was a nice night and the patio was poppin', but I decided to sit inside. I had their dessert blossom tea and decided on the diavola pizza. It was really good, one of the top pizzas I've had. I was in a rush but decided to get the banana nutella crepe which was a delicious mistake. Service was good. There was a mistake on my bill but the staff worked to quickly fix it. No doubt I'll be back."
Three,"""My husband and I used to be regulars here. The food and service are both good so we looked passed the fact that a lunch was at minimum $30 with the tip. Then after they hook you, they pull a switch-a-roo. The menu suddenly changes and the prices increased. All this within a few months of opening as a new restaurant. The worst part about this is that many of their best items (which I assume were also very popular) changed dramatically and not in a good way. One example is a wonderful prosciutto salad which complimented fresh melon mixed in a bed of arugula. It is now a mixed green salad with prosciutto and strawberries. Since when does prosciutto go with strawberries? Even a \simple\"""" customer such as myself knows what works best. Regardless, I tried it with the new combination and have decided to go back to Paradise Bakery down the street to get my salad fix. What a bummer! Oh, and this item suddenly increased in price from $9 to $11 after making it a cheaper way! Another item I miss- the grits. You can't find them anywhere and I was so happy to see them on the menu. Well, no longer folks! So save yourselves the money and grab breakfast/lunch where it doesn't hurt as much like the Egg and I less than a mile away. I'm truly bummed out because I was so excited to have a place like this around."""""""
Four,"Decided to go for Round 2 for a light dinner this time.  I found the food and service to be superior to our last experience.\n\nThe husband and I shared the mini mushroom pan fry, and I see why it is their signature dish.  It was so good that I will not be sharing next time.  We also had the dungeness crab stack.  This is pricey ($20) for a small plate, but it was fabulous.  We had the cuppa' red hot chocolate to finish.  It was a to-die-for dessert.  A chocolate pot de creme (custard) with chipotle crema and a chocolate chipotle cookie.  Spicy, rich, decadent, all good things.\n\nOur server was excellent from start to finish.  This time I am confident we will return, just maybe not at lunch."
Five,This place is awesome! Mesa's downtown is becoming more and more engaging and unique amongst Phoenix's surrounding cities and if you're along this strip for the 2nd Friday art walk or visiting any of the other unique and interesting stores in downtown Mesa be sure to make Lo-Fi THE place to stop in and take a quick break. You'll most likely be served by the owner himself (or a barista under the owners watchful eye) and he is just an awesome dude. Support your local businesses and help grow the AZ economy! \n\nThey are always whipping up a new latest and greatest batch of home-made vegan delicacies and even if you're not into coffee they have a wide range of other drinks and pastries to make the visit well worth it. I stop in every 2nd Friday Art walk I attend and try something new and it's always delicious!
Four,"I met an old friend here for sushi last night and was stuffed! these guys have a wide variety of rolls with different seafoods, textures, and temperatures. their spicy tuna is nicely seasoned and all of their food was impeccably fresh.\n\nalso, my friend told me that these guys aced their health food inspection which i know is important to some of you yelpers.\n\nminus one star only because they close at 10. with good food and lots of beer i usually want to stay out later. so go here, but don't go too late, or you will accidentally waste your spicy tuna too."
Five,"I have been coming to Greulich's Automotive for years.   I found out about this place from a friend and it was close to my work, so I thought I'd check it out.  I had to to get my electronic seat fixed and an oil change.  I didn't have a way to get to work since I needed to leave my car there, the manager actually drove me to and from work so I can get my car fixed. \n\nJust a month ago, I needed my back light fixed and they did it for free.  I also, came back for a circuit that was out and they did it for $30 when Nissan was charging me $160.  I didn't have cash on me, so they said I can come and bring it to them whenever!  HA!

Five,"This is one of my favorite dining experiences ever! I would suggest anyone traveling to Phoenix to have dinner here! As you walk in, you pass a bull hanging out in the entrance. A real bull. If you get seated downstairs, feel free to take the SLIDE. Yes a SLIDE. The food portions were HUGE. I could barely eat half my meal. Rattle snake is on the menu with a fabulous cucumber sauce. I got a 'I ate the snake' t-shirt as a souvenir. When the waiter brought the bill, he also brought a bucket of cotton candy for us! How cool. The view of Phoenix from our table was spectacular.\nHowever, a bit of warning. Your clothes will smell of this place for a good 2 washings. Walking around the next two days, I would pass people that had eaten dinner at the Rooste the night before. It was quite obvious."
Two,"""Tonight I tested out the new Loving Hut.

Three,"I fear the backlash, but I must be honest. I thought it was meh.\n\nWe managed to get in before the crazy line; it helped that it was raining outside.\n\nGot the Green Chile Burrito Enchilada style as recommended.

I think I would have preferred the burrito dry but with their hot sauce.\nHubby felt the same about his Red Chile Burrito.  \n\nI'm always happy to patronize a local mom&pop place, but I don't see all the hype.  Am I just spoiled by LA Mexican food?  Perhaps."
Four,"This is another spot that is great for bringing the furry friends. I like seeing other people out who include their dogs in the fun. Who wants to leave them home when they are so cute? I love the orange tables, the small inside space is cute but I haven't ever dined inside because Clover always comes with. \n\nI think I was rubbed the wrong way the first time I came here because the waitress was stand-offish, but now I realize that is kind of the approach at this place. Not a bad thing though. I'm usually not out to make a BFF while I'm eating. Anyway, like others have said, it's best to show up for brunch on a lazy saturday when you're not in a big rush. I've had the apple pancakes and they were SO good. Honey butter and warm maple syrup. Wow they were fantastic. \n\nI brought my vegetarian pals and they loved the food, they were both able to find something they liked. So basically there is something for everyone here. Not to mention the best beer list around. It is annoying, though, that they are often out of the beers on the list so you have to keep picking.\n\nAll in all, a great spot to hang out and enjoy your company. I love the park adjacent to the patio, a great spot to walk around after eating."
Five,"Mims Burger & Mexican Food was revealed to me by my sister and sometimes when I think about it (even when I JUST ate), my stomach growls.  The restaurant itself just SMELLS GOOD sitting there and waiting for your food to arrive.\n\nThe strange name would sort of, you know, ordinarily turn me off from trying the place because I think when restaurants serve this AND this they usually just serve two wildly different forms of food, both of which suck.  Mims serves legitimately good Mexican food, burgers, hotdogs and everything else.\n\nEven if you're NOT in the area, it's worth going a bit out of your way for it.\n\nFive stars.  Places don't get much better."
Four,"Went here last Saturday night. I am slowly eating my way through all of the steak joints in PHX. The view is spectacular, the decor is fresh and modern- befitting a proper steak joint. First, I just want to say that this place makes a proper old fashioned. I took a sip, smiled and poured a little on the floor for Don Draper. But when it comes right down to it, you got to judge the place on the food that is part of the name, right? Steak!! \n\nI ordered the filet. Usually, I will get a rib-eye or a porterhouse, but it is bikini season after all. Anyway, I order my usual medium rare, we get some asparagus(sp?) and prepare to chow down. Oh, we had oysters to start and they were great, but get some cocktail sauce unless you really love vinegar on your oysters. Back to the steak- her's was perfectly cooked and mine came about medium well. I have officially become a steak snob because I hate when my $45 piece of beef is molested by too much heat!! I sent it back, my date called me a meat princess and I thought I had a great new Yelp name. After lots of apologizing by the very attentive staff, I got my second one and it was perfecto. Second time's the charm I guess. I really liked this place and you will too."
Four,"""Yes! Yesterday I decided to eat whatever I wanted and what do I go do?? Of course I go to a place with Chicago in its name! Being one of those many people in Phoenix from the Chi, I can definitely say that this place has the right stuff! If it were a little more compact and there wasn't a mountain to look at outside, I would almost think that I was back home! But enough about that. Let's get to the food!\n\nI had a slider, a 1/3 lb cheddar and some fries. All this was under $10 so the prices get a thumbs up! Flavor-wise, the food kicked my mouth's ass... The slider had me saying, \White Castle, what??\"""" The fries were crispy on the outside and soft/hot on the inside (which is pretty much perfect). Lastly, the burger...oh the burger. Yeah, if you're craving a juicy, cheesy, greasy and all around mouthwatering burger, look no further. Every bite made me take a look at the burger and think of how good it was.\n\nIt is safe to assume that I'll be back to this place to try more of their food. Next time I'm definitely getting a Chi-town dog! =)"""""""
Four,"If you want bruschetta, you cannot go wrong here!  You get to pick four.

Five,I have been going to La Fontanella for almost 10 years and it never disappoints!! I love the atmosphere--it's always cozy and comfortable and the staff is always very friendly and attentive.  Next time you want to splurge on some decadent homemade pasta this is the place to go.  I can't help getting the butternut squash ravioli everytime-- it is absolutely delicious!!  I have never had anything that I didn't like here.  La Fontanella definitely has the best italian in the city-- FIVE STARS!!
Five,"I've always loved this salon because the staff are all so nice and the services are reasonably priced for the quality of work received. I've never left here with a bad manicure or gel nails.  The nails don't lift and I can usually stretch over two weeks in between fills.  When I don't have tips put on, US Nails also does a great traditional manicure and really takes the time to groom my hands for a fair price. \n\nEven better, the staff and owner always remember me!  I moved away and came back three years later and the owner remembered who I was and asked why I had been missing. Great customer service always brings me back :)"
Five,"""Sushi Brokers is the best sushi Az has to offer. If your a sushi lover you must have Sushi Brokers fish. All their fish is fresh and very good! I have to go there at least 3-4 times a week. They play good music but I wish they would mix in some country nights though. We all love Sushi Brokers, and all my friends agree they make Raw, Pure, Sapporo's, and the rest look like a tasteless bland wanna be sushi joints. Plus those places seem to be into the \seen\"""" rather than their food. If you want gret Sushi you must go to Sushi Brokers even though their Chefs are Mexican (go figure) and not Japanese their fish and rolls are the best in Az.  NOW.....If your in Vegas you must go to Sushi Avenue......that place is the best in the world and I have traveled all over to know they really are the best."""""""
Four,"If times are ever desperate enough, I know I can raid our video library and make a little money selling them to Zia. As painful as it would be, I'd even consider selling my Charmed DVD collection, so long as the price is right. \n\nZia is an amazing store where I've spent entirely too much money and grown our video collection substantially. Zia is where I went to get all the Saw movies prior to seeing the most recent instalment in the theater. And Zia is where we've purchased several records/vinyl. \n\nI have the Zia card but haven't a clue what it actually does, outside of tracking what I buy and how frequently I wander into the stores. While this location is in our neighborhood, I have to admit the location in Tempe has proven more fruitful in tracking down some really cool CDs. That's where I found a box set of David Sedaris audiobooks."
Five,"BLT Steak truly is a special occasion restaurant, as my boyfriend and I learned firsthand on Valentine's Day. We arrived at the JW Marriott Resort's restaurant a little early and were greeted by the hostess, who then apologized that they were running a little behind on reservations. Not a problem, since we'd hoped to have a drink in the bar before dinner. The bartender made a good Manhattan for my sweetie and I enjoyed my V-Day special drink, which was a prickly pear-flavored Cosmo. Just a little while later, we were approached by a woman who announced that our table was ready, placed our drinks on a silver tray, and escorted us to our seats. (I love when restaurants go the extra step and take care of your drinks for you. Failing that, I love when my date carries my drink for me.)\n\nAt our table, we were faced with a terrible decision: order off the $60 special prix-fixe menu or select from one of the many prime cuts of steak on offer. The horror! Fortunately for us, the items on the prix-fixe menu were also available a la carte. We decided to splurge and get the most romantic dish on the menu: the 40 oz. Porterhouse for two, plus a roasted beet salad starter from the prix-fixe menu and sides of creamed spinach and potatoes au gratin. Last of all we selected Roquefort and Bearnaise from the list of sauces. Honestly, there were so many choices in each category and everything sounded so great that it took us about half an hour before we could place our order. Our server was patient with us throughout and never made us feel rushed.\n\nSometime in between ordering our entrees and receiving the complimentary gigantic popovers for which BLT is famous (and rightly so), we were approached by the sommelier who offered recommendations, such as a bottle of DeLille Cellars D2 2007.\n\nOur Porterhouse was a massive two inches thick, cooked to the requested medium-rare, topped with a thyme compound butter, and served sliced on the bone with a roasted head of garlic alongside. My first bite of steak practically melted in my mouth, and though they didn't need it, the remainder of my bites were topped with either sauce. Some of the steak seemed to be a bit more done, but that's to be expected when trying to cook such a thick, bone-in cut. I found that I preferred the Roquefort with the more well-done pieces, and the Bearnaise with the rare.\n\nThe sides arrived in adorable individual Staub casseroles and were also mouth-watering. The gratin was a perfectly arranged layer of potato coins bathed in a rich, creamy, cheesy sauce with a hint of roasted garlic. And the creamed spinach was the best I've had: not too saucy and with the perfect amount of nutmeg.\n\nThroughout the meal, the wine paired well and really opened up as the evening progressed. At the conclusion of the meal, however, I realized that the full-bodied wine's flavor had changed to something more, well, saline. In fact, the only note I could taste was salt--and my boyfriend agreed. When Scott came by to check on us, we invited him to taste some of the wine. He declined politely, but when we explained that the flavor of the wine was now off, he poured a small taste off the floor. When he returned he conceded that he could see how we felt it was now salty, and said that perhaps it would have benefited from being decanted. Did we want it taken off our bill? Just then, although we'd declined dessert, our server placed a complimentary plate of brownie-like bites on the table. As Scott was talking, I took a bite and then a sip of the wine. Again, the wine's flavor changed and really enhanced the toffee flavor of the little cake. My boyfriend told Scott that the wine had been fine up until the end--and was again perfect. Still, Scott insisted that we have two glasses of dessert wine, especially since we'd received yet another complimentary dessert plate, this time of chocolate mousse-filled cornets.\n\nAs we sipped the late harvest Zinfandel and the Hungarian Tokaji, we chatted with Scott and learned that he is originally from Napa. We mentioned that we are from the Bay Area and enjoy going up to wine country. But next time we'll be well armed with his suggestions of wineries to try.\n\nMy sweetie and I ended up closing down the restaurant, with full bellies and fond memories. Even though there had been some minor imperfections with our meal, the personal attention we received from Scott Larson and the gracious service ensured this five-star review."
Four,"Great selection of wine and beer! Beats the heck out of Bevmo or any other liquor store I've been to. I have been back several times...a bottle of wine is becoming my token gift when attending parties or events. The wine is well organized and easy to find if you're looking for something specific. If you are not sure what you'd like, the staff is very helpful and the labels will spell out for you which wines are the most popular."
Four,"Four stars for four reasons: \n\n1. Convenience \n2. Price \n3. Location \n4. Wait time \n\n1. Convenience \n\nThe Carwasher is conveniently located in the heart of Old Town. I pass by the car wash several times a day and it's always a friendly reminder that I really should keep my car more squeaky clean. So when I do decide to take the plunge, chances are, I'm not too far from The Car Washer. In addition, it's located next to a CVS and coffee shop so if I opt for the more detailed wash, I've got options besides waiting on the rock wall. \n\n2. Price \n\nDepending on the wash mood my car is in, I can go with a wash as cheap as $4 or as expensive as $80. The $4 wash is excellent because it's an in and out exterior car was but not your normal run of the mill cheap wash. They do a great job on the exterior and I leave happy on the outside. When I decide to make my interior look just as sparkly clean, they offer detailed car washes for a relatively reasonable price. Since I do interior far and few between, I normally go the middle of the road price range when I do get a car wash, but if I was smart and more frequently, I could get the inside and outside done for around $17. \n\n3. Location \n\nLocation and convenience go hand in hand but as I mentioned in #1, the location is prime and chances are, people drive by The Car Washer and don't even realize it's there. Like I said, it's in the heart of Old Town and within walking distance of practically everything. \n\n4. Wait time \n\nAnd finally, wait time. They are thorough with their cleaning and they don't skimp on the detailing if you go for the pricier option. However, for the level of work they do and the detail they put into it, they do so in a relatively short amount of time. For a detailed car wash, it's about a 30 minute wait time, but if you go for a cheaper car wash, it's only about 10 minutes."
Four,"I really like ketzel, for what it is. It's not super authentic but they have good food. They serve a variety of different salsas, which is unique, and their burro ketzel (with steak) is fantastic. I get it everytime. I refuse to go to all the lame chains in my area and think ketzel is a cute Mexican restaurant that offers something different, which is nice. My only complaint would be that I think they are a little overpriced and when they do send out coupons, they are pretty lame. Other then that, I like ketzel and would recommend it."
Five,"After reading all the rave reviews about BLT Steak's happy hour I wanted to try it for myself. Yelpers, once again you have not failed me. The rave reviews were spot on - this place is fantastic. \n\nBoyfriend and I snagged ourselves a comfy spot on a couch next to the firepit on the patio. The atmosphere is comfortable, romantic and warm. We were immediately greeted by our waitress who pointed out the happy hour menu. They have several drink options and many food options. We were there for the food and ordered a few items to share - the popovers (a must), the charcuterie plate, the burger and the truffle fries.\n\nHands down the standout of the night was the popovers. They were huge, fluffy, and full of eggy goodness. They are served with butter and salt - it's really all they need - yum! But I added in some of the meat from the charcuterie plate and it was an excellent combo if I do say so myself. Everyone who says get the popovers is right - get the popovers!\n\nThe burger was very tasty. A good size - plenty for sharing and cooked just right. The fries were my least favorite. I was excited by the description - truffle fries with parmesan cheese - but the fries were overcooked (too hard) and the truffle was overpowering. Not my thing I guess.\n\nThe service was really good too. Even though you'd spend WAY more on dinner inside I never felt like I was part of the cheap crowd. I felt like we were treated the same way we would be if we were dropping $200 even though we dropped less that $50. I appreciated that and it's smart because now I'm very likely to come back and blow a wad on a special occasion! Well played, BLT Steak!\n\n I highly recommend BLT Steak's happy hour. It was the dining highlight of my weekend."
Five,"""I call this \The Cake Store\"""".  That's the only name it needs to me.  It's been \""""The Cake Store\"""" since I was about 5 and I used to come here with my Aunt who make professional cakes.  While she hunted for what she needed and scoped out what was new, I was in imaginative kids heaven.  Rows upon rows of tiny cake toppers.  Mini barbie dolls, mini cans of coke (and beer), teddy bears, army men, sports cars, Disney characters, Strawberry shortcake, 50's Retro Bowling themed stuff - and SO much more.  And all of these things are available from things as small as pick flags (they stick in cupcakes or occationally on cakes) all the way up to large 3D things to make a \""""setting\"""" on a cake.  It's pretty amazing.  \n\nThen there are the professional baking pans and accessories.  I love the new cupcake trees, and I first saw them here.  They have great wedding cake pans too.  Don't want to make your own frosting and fillings?  They have pre-made stuff here so you don't have to even bother.  Or are you more a candy person?  They have tons of candy molds for just about any possible creation - and candy chips that you can melt down.  \n\nOr, if you'd love to do this but are clueless - guess who offers classes?  They have a full class room right next door with Wilton classes teaching everything from cake decorating to cookie bouquets and seasonal fun classes like gingerbread house creating.  \n\nAmazing stuff and definitely the best selection in the valley"""""""
Three,"""Dont drink the martinis.  Ick.  Two for one?  I couldnt even get through my first.  Way too sweet and where is this booze you speak of?  And yes, Kristin, sticky hands!!!  Gross.  \n\nActually my thoughts on Devils North are very similar to Kristin's...  I cant figure out why/if I like this place.  It really does have a ton of potential and some really great bathrooms and you know how that scores big points with me.  But the music is way off (we definitely thought \wedding music\"""" at some points last night) and the crowd doesnt hold a candle to the Old Town location's clientele.  Older, worse dancers, and 30 somethings trying to relive their 20s.  Annoying.  \n\nWhy is everyone so damn drunk (and thus, yes, humping each others legs...I saw that too, WTF)??  Thursday happy hour.  Look past the faux fancy martini menu and go for whatever usually floats your boat.  EVERYTHING is 2 for 1 all night long.  \n\nThe food is actually pretty good too if you need some sustanance...they have some ridiculous deal for happy hour like you can pick 3 tapas/salads for $12 or something.  Go ahead and eat, or after your third double Goose and soda you might be the one humping legs on the dance floor.  \n\nGood layout of the bar, dont have to wait too long for drinks, clean bathrooms with attendant, usually free bottled water on the way out.

One,"""We visited Indulge on their 3rd day open. They weren't overly busy but the kitchen was obviously backed up. We arrived at nearly 1pm and there was a lady at the counter complaining about waiting 45 minutes and not having received her meal. We decided to try it anyway. There was no hostess at the hostess stand (and no bar tender at the bar) so we proceeded to a counter that was stocked with clipboards containing menus. We stand at the counter, fill out the menus and after several minutes are finally told we could seat ourselves. After sitting down it's several more minutes before someone stops by to take our drink order. After waiting too long for the waitress to come back, we finally give up and take our orders directly to counter. At this point I start my stop watch. 25 minutes pass and our fries arrive; 10 minutes after that our burgers arrive. It was very interesting that we all received \mostly\"""" what we ordered... of the 4 people at the table, everyone's burger was slightly wrong -- mismatched toppings and sauces. We now understood the motto on the back of the servers' shirts, \""""order what you want - eat what you get\"""". \n\nWhile Indulge has a decent location, is nicely decorated, and provides an interesting menu concept they don't yet have their process working well. Unfortunately, even if the process was working well I think their menu is overpriced for what you get. $13.50 for a small Kobe burger with no sides is a bit steep for this type of restaurant. If they're still there in a couple months I may try again, but then again, maybe not."""""""
Four,"We've been here twice now and both times were very pleasant. You have to get the pretzel fondue - its amazing. It is basically what you always dreamed of when ordering a pretzel and cheese sauce at the ball park - only this time the cheese dip is amazing and flavorful and the pretzel is moist and perfectly warm. For dinner we had the crab stuffed chicken which was very good and the Bolognese with Ricotta Dumplings. This dish was amazingly good - unfortunately it had been removed from the menu for some reason by the time we got back for our second visit. \n\nThe second visit was to kill an hour before taking friends to the airport. We got an assortment of beers and appetizers - all were good especially the rock shrimp, the bacon and cheese stuffed potato bites (not the real name) and of course the pretzel fondue again. We sat on the patio and the open atmosphere was great. Highly recommend as a change from the usual fare."
Four,"Please bear in mind that I try new things as they come. Korean has always mystified me..

This place is awesome! The service was pleasant and they completely demystified Korean BBQ for us.. my tummy is happy we went! Had the beef with mushrooms as well as the pork slices in chile paste. The server cooked the food in front of us on the tabletop grill which was very cool.. the food was fresh and just delish! The panchan was fresh and many, I think about 8 in all.. Oh the dressing on the cabbage salad, just amazing!\n\nIf anyone ever wants to go out for Korean, Im so there!"

The mozzarella tasted old...\n\nThe atmosphere is friendly enough that you can go and have a drink and get a quick bite, as long as you stick with the hummus..."
Five,"Very good pizza. Every bit as good as the overhyped Pizzaria Bianco,and no 3 hour wait. \nHad a very good mushroom and pancetta pizza and a strawberry and gorgonzola salad. Both were top notch.

Nice bar that opens to the patio. \nReally all in all a very good experience. Good food, good wine, happy staff, reasonably priced.

Four,"The food here is consistently good. We tend to come here annually at Christmastime while shopping at the mall. Went last week with the ladies and had the ultimate food envy watching my cohort eat a chicken salad sandwich. Came back this week to test it out and it is the BEST chicken salad sandwich I have ever eaten. May have to add this to my rotation of dining spots. \nMy other dining mates had  the Shepards Pie, which was delicious and the grilled fish tacos which were also exceptional.

Four,"The perfect place for hangover food!\nI cannot believe it took me so long to make my way to Over Easy... but it was worth the wait for sure!  Today I went to brunch at Over Easy with a party of 4 (that's the way to go by the way, so that you can taste  a bit of everything!)\n\nNeedless to say, we'd all had a few too many drinks last night, and we needed a good greasy spoon, fill your tummy, type of meal.  We arrived around 10:15 on a Saturday and had about a 20 minute wait, but it went by fast and was so worth it!  Brian hooked us up with a table inside and our server brought us ice waters and coffee immediately.  There were so many menu items that sounded amazing, so we decided to start with the waffle for the table as an appetizer.  Yum!  (It's got a vanilla malt flavor that is out of this world good!)  We also ordered a side of crispy bacon for the table - such a treat!\n\nI went with the egg white asparagus omelet and added mushrooms to it plus a side of hash browns.  The asparagus was seriously some of the best I've had and I cleaned my plate!  Jared went with steak and eggs over sleazy - it looked so good I had to taste it and that too was fantastic!  The other couple we were with enjoyed their entrees too.  Although I didn't try them, the 'tots' looked good and I would suggest hash browns or tots before the breakfast potatoes.\n\nAs you can imagine, this was a ton of food for the four of us, but since we were all hungover and hungry, we did pretty well with it... With tip, I think the total for all of us was just under $60 - it may seem expensive, but it was worth every penny!\n\nI usually like some fruit, tomato, yogurt, or cottage cheese options.  That's the only reason for 4 stars instead of 5.  I think they keep it simple because of their limited space in this location.  With that said, Chef Aaron May and his team are on a roll with great restaurant concepts and I'm definitely a loyal fan.  I'll be back to Over Easy again soon as well as continue to frequent Sol Y Sombra and the up and coming new restaurants when they open as well!"
Four,"""Let me start off by saying I really don't like seafood... so I'm not very qualified to review this place. However, my friend invited some of us to stop by here Friday to celebrate her just-received and hard-earned master's degree from ASU. So I went. We ate in the oyster bar area. The place is really cute. Sure, it looks kind of corporate, but in a nice way. It's definitely the kind of place I would want to stop by for drinks with my friends. The wine list was OK, and they had some nice sake and martinis. Our waitress was great and really friendly. \nThe seafood platter they ordered smelled good.. and everyone who ate it said it was tasty.\nIt's definitely a bit pricey, but if the seafood is really that fresh, I guess it's worth it. \nI'll probably bring my parents here when they visit and then I'll try something off the menu. The choices (aside from the sushi and seafood platters) range from pricey things like $20+  for the trout or the macadamia-nut crusted halibut to $12 tuna melts. \nIn the meantime, I have a good opinion of this place.\nOh, and it's actually in the parking lot area of Tempe Marketplace, not in that annoying pedestrian part dubbed \The District.\"""" So that earns it some points, too."""""""
Five,"I really like this place.

I can see how the condiment station might be a turnoff for some but considering I like my burger pretty plain it didn't really bother me. We rode the light rail so we didn't have issues with parking but I can see how the parking might be problematic around lunch time. I dig the tree stumps as chairs but that's just me.

We received a coupon for 1 free dozen wings with the purchase of a large pizza and decided to give it a whirl.\n\nWe arrived around 6:45 on a Friday evening and decided to sit in the bar- the place was busy but there were still a few tables available.  We sat at a booth and were able to have privacy in addition to a view of plenty of televisions.  It took a little while for someone to come over and greet us but that is my only complaint about the whole experience.\n\nI ordered a glass of a house red wine, on recommendation from the waitress and my husband got a bud light draft ( both were discounted because of a HH special that lasted til 7!!!).  We ordered wings as an app and they were FANTASTIC, as a side note a dozen without a coupon will run you  $6.00- which is nothing considering how large the wings were.  We had the honey hot, great flavor, good size, a lot of meat,  we will definitely order those again.\n\nWe then put our order for a large pizza (neither of us was that hungry anymore b/c of the wings but the coupon required the large) and the waitress even tried to down-sell us on the pizza, letting us know that their large is more than enough food for the two of us. We appreciated the consideration but had the coupon so ordered the large.  Our pizza had sausage, garlic, and pepperoni...and was fabulous.  The amount of sauce, meat etc was perfect and the dough was amazing.  My husband actually commented that the lady next to us wasn't eating her crust... he couldn't understand why she was wasting it when it tasted so good.  We ended up with extra slices to take home for leftovers and overall a great experience.\n\nI highly recommend trying out Upper Crust, it's a nice local joint with good service, great food, and reasonable prices.... a combo that I think is hard to find!"
Five,"This is the definition of a hidden gem! Nestled in a strip mall, this cute little place will leave you delighted and stuffed! \n\nThe extensive menu offers heaping portions and endless options. I've had their eggplant entree, greek salad, artichoke dip, pizza, etc. and I have no complaints about a single one of them! Everything is fantastic! \n\nI even took my incredibly picky parents to this place and they've been back 4 or 5 times...now that's truly telling of the place."
Four,I happened to stumble upon Francesca's at Kierland recently while running a few errands. It looked very interesting so I decided to go in and take a gander. I was pleasantly surprised at all the funky fun jewelry and accessories. My friends tell me I am their fashion icon because I have a knack for throwing together a killer outfit for any occasion from anyone's closet. Anyone need a stylist??? \n\nFrancesca's is the perfect place to pick up some unique accessories and clothing inexpensively. I am always looking for pieces that are original and that no one else has and I found quite a few items here to add to my wardrobe. I highly recommend stopping and checking it out if you are in the neighborhood!
Four,"""I had been wanting to check this place out but couldn't get myself in the door even though I live around the corner. Then I found out they have the best birthday deal in town and picked up a free birthday sub. It was full sized, didn't require an additional order, and didn't demand my signature promising my first born to be greeted into the world with a sub and fire hat so I was both shocked and pleasantly surprised. I ordered the hook and ladder because it appeared the one most advertised. It has turkey, ham, and montery jack cheese. The boyfriend stole a bite and liked it as did I. I am personally partial to feeling healthy with a vegged out raw food \healthy tasting\"""" fare but for a birthday caloric splurge after a nice run, I am a fan. \n\nTip: I would order ahead online during rush times, I felt like I waited about 15 minutes for my sub and eyed the people that ordered ahead enviously. I practically pounced on the sandwich when I saw the reciept before the lady even called for it which is why I should be (but sadly am not) too embarrassed to come back.\n\nI should also warn that I raised my star rating to a 4 because it was an awesome birthday deal, I liked the fireman ambience, and I like the cool soda/hotsauce trend. The sandwich itselt was just a little average."""""""
Two,"""Stopped here one morning cause it's on my way to work.  I always see a lot of police cars there, and figure if the cops are eating there religiously then it's gotta be worth a shot.\n\nMeh.   Honestly, after seeing them make my iced mocha with hershy's syrup I became distraught, but when I tasted it I was pleasantly suprised.  Probably the best \hershy mocha\"""" I've ever had.   \n\nThe fried egg sandwich with bacon was a cluster.  FRIED implies..  well fried, NOT SCRAMBLED.  Sorry for the caps usuage but  I was just terribly dissapointed.  My scramble stack of blandness on bread was a catastrophy. \n\nI might come back so I can try something else and boost the rating.  They only take cash too... a bummer cause I only carry my card (so I don't spend all my cash).\n\nThe restaurant in convieniently located next to the I-17 and Bethany Home Rd, and is pretty cool little place on the inside.  The owner was very nice and the prices are low.  \n\nMeh."""""""
Three,"I swore off Chipotle after my first experience several years ago while living in CA.  I finally gave in and gave it another shot. A buy 1 get 1 free certainly helps!\n\nThe burrito is average, but the meat is a bit chewy and salty (chicken and beef)  The quality of meat was the problem I had with my previous burrito and not much has changed in the many years since my last visit to a Chipotle. .\n\nFor similar chain burrito places, Chipotle ranks above Moes, but is behind Baja Fresh, Qdoba etc.\n \nOur table had chips and guacamole. The guacamole was excellent!  \n\nThe staff was very friendly and our burritos were served very quickly."
Four,Very friendly staff and always willing to offer a helping hand. I accidentally left my wallet in a shopping cart a few weeks ago. I returned about 20 mins later and was told by member services that one of the boys that retrieves the carts found it and turned it in. Everything was still in even the cash. Someone also always seem to be around the water section to help me lift and put a couple of cases in my cart. My son and I also have lunch here sometimes. Hot dog combo pizza slice and an icee all for less than $5!
Five,"Stopped in here a few weeks back and it was great! The owners were very nice and friendly, seemed very knowledgeable about the food. I was excited seeing a huge smoker on a trailer in the parking lot. We ordered the pulled pork BBQ sandwiches and the mac n cheese. Both were great! The meat was very soft and tender and the sauce was great! Very flavorful, spicy and had a nice kick to it. I'd definitely go back the next time I'm in the area."
Two,"""The only thing \Chicago style\"""" at Oregano's is the time it takes to get your pizza once it's been ordered. I called on a Sunday night and was told it would be 90 minutes before I could come pick it up. I arrived right on time, and my pizza & garlic bread were pulled from an under-the-counter heater and handed over. \n\nClearly, I'm starving having had to wait so long until dinner so I'm pretty excited to pull the pizza out of the box and get it on to the plate once I make it back home. Though when I lifted the lid, the excitement fizzled. The pizza did not look fresh, and when I pulled out the first thin crust slice it fell limp and nearly slid itself back into the box. That was worrisome so I carefully transfered a few more squares over, then opened the foil for the garlic bread. More sogginess, and by the looks of the bread it may have been placed under my pizza box inside the pizza-kryptonite heater. Adding insult to injury, the pizza was cool! I actually had to put it in the microwave less than 10 minutes after picking it up. Seriously?!\n\nThe first bite of both were equally disappointing. It was hard to handle the pizza squares because they were so limp/soggy, and when I folded it in half the topping separated from the crust as if it had been placed there as a late afterthought. Thin crust pizza should be CRISPY! It doesn't qualify as \""""thin crust\"""" just because the crust is thin! And I've had better garlic bread come with a frozen dinner.\n\nVery disappointed. 1 - If my pizza had been ready earlier than they told me to arrive, they should have called me. They took my number when I placed the order. 2 - The phrase \""""Chicago-Style Pizza\"""" should be regulated like organic and kosher. It's clearly being abused by this establishment. Next time I'll satisfy my craving in the frozen section of the grocer."""""""
Four,"""I like my local library I visit it about once a month. I have a long history of library patronage, going back to my grammar school days when I participated in summer reading programs. During my senior year in high school I worked as a page in my home town.

One,"""i went to streets of new york last week with a friend of mine, looking to try a new place for chicken wings.\nbut the first thing i noticed when we stepped in was that the place was filthy (the bathroom looked like it hadnt been cleaned for a month)\nwhen i sat back down my friend told me to look at the \clean\"""" plates that they had given us. i picked one up and it was covered with old salad, crutons and dressing. it looked like they just took it off some other dirty table and given it to us. the wings were terrible, they were pretty much just frozen chicken nuggets drenched in 5 pounds of sauce, and the \""""water\"""" they gave us tasted like a half old soda, half water mixture. i was disgusted  at this place and recomend that anyone looking for pizza or wings take their business elsewhere."""""""
Five,"Chelsea's is a great restaurant. Absolutely the most uncomfortable bar area ever, but the food is so incredible that I just avoid the bar entirely. \n\nI enjoy that you won't find a Budweiser or Coors here (don't hate... I love my Bud Light poolside as much as the next red-blooded Arizona asshole, but it's a nice touch to expose those who might otherwise be unwilling to something new and delicious. Case in point: my father, a republican, Nascar-watching Miller Lite drinker, loves to have a Stella while he's here. That's saying something.). The food is wonderfully and artfully prepared, and my otherwise simple male companions always find new favorites here. \n\nThe menu features accessibly delicious meals that men won't feel emasculated ordering (the spit-roasted prime rib, dixie pan-fried chicken), but still accommodates that girly bitch who lives at 44th and Thomas, but insists she's in Arcadia (Arcadia Featured salad, Vegetarian Nut Burger).\n\nThis could be why my Chelsea's is the only place my kooky family can agree upon."
Three,"I had heard and read so many good things about Sierra Bonita I was excited to finally get a chance to go with my brother & sis in law for her birthday. A first glance the place is impressive. It's quaint with a cowboy, southwestern style interior. When arriving everyone was nice and pleasant. It kinda of goes downhill from there.\n\nMy husband asked if he could have chips and salsa. Waitress informs us they only have guacamole, it comes with chips and a salsa trio. Husband didn't want guacamole..only chips and salsa. She brings chips and salsa, but still charges us $9..same price as the guac with the chips and salsa.\n\nI ordered the Wild Salmon. If I could base this review on just the sides it would have gotten 5 stars. The poblano creamed corn was amazing but there wasn't enough of it, maybe a tablespoon, 2 at best. The roasted yukon gold potatoes were roasted perfectly, the only thing they were missing was salt. Easy fix though, right? The salmon was a nice thick piece of fish ever so slightly overcooked, it was supposed to have a red chile glaze, but the glaze had a very floral taste that just didn't work with the fish, at least not for me. \n\nThe husband had the Enchiladas Suiza, with carne instead of chicken. They looked good, he said they were ok. Wished he could have that meat in a Filibertos burrito..would be heaven. His words not mine.\n\nThe child had kid's mac & cheese. Was an order of oily penne pasta with a sprinkle of some sort of cheese on top..he didn't eat it. \n\nWhen our bill arrived we asked if it could be split. Gratuity was already added to the total, thats ok there were several of us,but my problem is when she split the ticket 3 ways she added gratuity again..double the tip...I don't think so.\n\nThe poblano creamed corn was the highlight of my meal and I would have been a happy camper with a large bowl of it, but the $80 price tag for enchiladas, salmon, chips & salsa, oily penne and 3 non-alcoholic drinks, plus the tax & tip was a little too much for our liking.\n\nNot sure if we will return to Sierra Bonita."
Four,"Authentic good food.  Casual place and visually nothing special.  The server was funny and cool, the food was great.  Our group ordered a variety of things from tacos to burritos and a whole bunch of things to go into here.  Everything was very good and tasty.  The only thing we thought was that the margs could have been better, nore simple and authentic.  They are a bit americanized with maybe sweet and sour, which sucks.  The food and beer are great though."
Two,"This place belongs in Scottsdale where they are more concerned with appearances than substance.  The place looks cool but the two times I have been, the main courses have been over cooked and last night, it was over cooked and cold!  Funny thing was it came out before we had taken two bites of our appetizers.  My guess is the waiter screwed up the timing when he put the order in.   There are better places if you want to enjoy the food but few places better in town if you want to be seen."
Five,"I recently needed 100 flyers printed.  I took a sample copy to the folks at Biltmore Pro-Print, and they were very patient, knowledgeable, and had excellent suggestions as to the paper choice.  They even advised me on what type of file would be best to give them for the best quality and the best price.  They had the flyers printed within 24 hours and I could not have been more pleased with the quality.  Their staff is very professional, very knowledgeable, and their prices are reasonable.  They certainly have my business from now on."
Three,"I like it. They serve food late night and have some good choices. Good deals during happy hour too. In about a dozen visits I have been able to try several things on the menu. My favorites are the cobb salad, the reuben sandwich (I ask for turkey instead of corned beef), and the green chile chicken sandwich.\n\nThe customer service is great. I brought my parents here for lunch on a recent visit, and the waitress overheard us talking about how it was their 40th anniversary weekend. She must have told the manager, because he appeared at the end of the meal with an ice cream sundae for my folks, a card for a free appetizer, as well as a greeting card where the staff signed their anniversary wishes. That was totally unexpected and very cool of them."
Three,"You can bring a Diet Coke can on the bus. \nAnd bottled water. \nI even saw a bag of chips.\nBack packs, briefcases and shopping bags.\nYou can even bring your own stinky body odor.\nLots of them you know!\nAnd I imagine you should bring $1.25. Only on this day. \nIt was free. \nHow cool. A free ride to the stadium. A/C!\nOh.\nJust don't bring a red plastic cup. \nThose. Are not allowed. \nYou will get yelled at. In front of people. \nBelieve me."
Three,"""decided to take the fam out for dinner last night, was reallly craving a juicy burger and a beer. I do have to say that the beer was great, but the food was just meh. We started with the calamari and the beer bread with beer cheese for an appetizer. I wasn't a fan of the beer bread, but maybe I just don't like beer bread. Nothing was \wrong\"""" with it, I we just weren't fans. The calamari was good, I liked it anyway.  \n\nI decided to get the black and bleu burger with onion rings, wife got the crispy shrimp tacos, my son had a smaller cheeseburger with garlic parm fries and my little daughter had a grilled cheese and sweet potato fries. My burger was cooked perfectly, but was somehow bland. Not sure how, with the bacon and bleu cheese fondue, but it was. I think the meat was just underseasoned, but overall a decent burger. I have to say the onion rings were terrible, not very crispy and soooo much \""""breading\"""". ick The wife's tacos were impossible to eat, super sloppy and just fell apart. My son reallly liked his burger and fries. \n\nOn to the beer. I had an awesome red beer then a pilsner, both very very good. The wife had the light rail cream ale, that was also awesome. In the future, I'll go back for the awesome beer and maybe just a simple cheeseburger."""""""
Four,"My friend and I had appointments for blow-outs at the Phoenix location and unfortunately when we got there the hot water heater was broken!  So the owner, Melodi, offered us complimentary makeup applications while we waited for it to be repaired.  The artist did an amazing job on my makeup and was so sweet.  The hot water heater still wasn't fixed so Melodi offered us free thermal styles with the curling iron.  Our hair looked so glamorous and when we went to dinner with our husbands that night they couldn't stop telling us how great we looked.  I was really impressed by how Melodi handled the situation with the hot water and I would definitely, definitely go back."
Four,"I'm a fan of Yogurtland, but I tried Zoyo last night.  Their Pumkin Pie is delicious!  The pumpkin spice flavor isn't too strong or too sweet.  My favorite so far is their Orchard Cherry.  It's a bit tart, but not too sweet.  I've heard rave reviews from others regarding their Cake Batter, but it was not good last night.  That was disappointing.  Also, the consistency of their yogurt varies.  The Maple Pancakes flavor was really mushy, not creamy like the others.\n\nThey have a good selection of toppings, including some uncommon ones like Fried Egg Gummies."
Five,"I went here for frys free weekend yay thanks frys and thanks to laura for telling me about it! I love this place best museum ever. I'm from San Francisco and I'd say this museum is a mix of the exploratorium and the academy of science. Place is amazing I'm for sure bringing my little brother here not so little brother that is he's 21! The place is soo boob.com!! I'm a nursing major and the found the anatomy and brain department amazing. I spent like 615644 hours there. The exhibits were so cool my favorites were this thing that slides over the body and does a scan over the body showing the parts letting you click on the screen while you glide the x-ray panel. Breath taking, I also loved the heart beat drums that went with your pulse, the digestive tract, and the surgery done on a manikin with a moving slideshow.  I love this place!! Will be back def. an Arizona must see and gem! At an affordable 12 or 14."
Five,"Great, Great, Great. Did I mention Great? What a cool spot, I'm sure to be a regular. It's located right across the street from Filmbar on 2nd st and Just South of Roosevelt. I LOVE the huge selection of beers. I did the sampler, which cost a measly $9 and allowed me to try 6 beers (around 4 oz each). 3 of the beers were great, 3 I hated, but that's the bonus in getting a flight! I also had a sausage sampler with housemade chorizo, some germain sausage and wild boar sausage. All of it was awesome. it was served with housemade ketchup, a fwe mustards, grilled onions and some potatoes. I can't wait to go back and get the same plate. Awesome ambiance, I was suprised how bright and airy the interior was."
Four,"My boyfriend and I go here at least once a month. We love to sit at the bar because the wait here is always long and the bartenders are so friendly here. We stick to a basic thin crust pepperoni, which is always good, but I've also had the Lady is a Scampi pasta and that's pretty good too. My favorite part is the chocolate chip pizza cookie! Yummy. Great patio to have lunch or dinner and a beer on a nice day."
Four,"Peoria needs more places like this.  It is tucked away on 83rd Avenue next to the Peoria Sports Complex.  As many of you West Valley kids know, it is difficult to find truly local spots on this side of town- sometimes even I have to settle for Red Robin when dining on that side of the Valley.  So, Prime Pizza breathes some nice, local fresh air into this area of town.\n\nThey offer basic appetizers (several types of bruschetta), salads, pasta and pizzas.  They also have happy hour specials from 4-7!  The happy hour include a select few food items and $2 off draft and house wines.  \n\nWe did a make your own pizza and spaghetti with garlic bread.  I have to be honest and say that I've grown to love whole wheat noodles so regular noodles taste too intense for me these days.  The marinara sauce in the spaghetti was great, though.  The pizza was saucy and cheesy- a bit tough on the very bottom of the crust but otherwise tasty.\n\nOur server was super friendly, and one of the co-owners even came over to chat with us.  He reigns from Chicago, but I wouldn't call this a Chicago pizzeria.  \n\nIf you're looking for a cute and unique restaurant in Peoria, I'd say you should stop into Prime Pizza!"
Four,Just moved to scottsdale and decided to try this place out! The roast beef sandwhich was good but the ambiance is what really did it for me. They had this east coast deli vibe going on and I loved the sound track they were playing. The italian soda was amazing. It teetered on the almost to sweet side but definitly made an everlasting impression (carmel creme flavor). Great place to get a good bite to eat although the items on the shelves (ie pastas tomato sauce cookies ect) seemed alittle over priced. I will definitly go there again.
Four,"I went to Sportsman's for a networking event last wk & really liked it.  We were able to use a section near the door that had cushy seating and oversize chairs.  It was a good spot for our group of around 20-30.\n\nIt's difficult to comment on cost b/c the event was complimentary and we ordered a few plates with fruit, cheeses, meats and olives that were perfect with the wines.  They even had a wine tasting area in the rear of the store that was a nice feature I haven't seen at the other local wine bars.  Service was great and I had no complaints there."
Five,"I have never left Lolo's not beaming with joy.  I love fried chicken and I love waffles, though not as much as chicken.  I believe that Lo-Lo's not only has the best fried chicken in Phoenix, but the best waffles as well.  If you enjoy either, you must come here.  You can also buy a mason jar of red drank.  This is available nowhere else in the valley.  The macaroni and cheese is pretty good, but not my favorite style.  The real show stopper besides the chicken and waffles is the Red Velvet Cake.  Indulge.  Seriously.  But make sure you share.\n\nAlso, this is a bad place for first dates because it takes a really really remarkable person to tear your attention away from the food."
Five,"What can I say that you don't know about this place? It's been reviewed over 50 times...  I had been dying to try it as I love a great pulled pork sandwich and everyone was telling me how great they were here!\n\nWell, I was not disappointed.  The pork was tender with great flavor, overflowing off the bun, creating a sticky BBQ mess (which is just the way I like it!) I went for the ranch beans instead of the fries, and while you don't get a lot, they were very good.  I skipped the corn bread and little dessert donuts (didn't need the carbs) but everyone else loved them. \n\nI'm still looking for the best BBQ pulled pork sandwich in Phoenix, but this is the leader so far!"
Four,"Came here for a Fashion/Art Show. Amazed by the prompt service even while crowded!\n\nHappy Hour is a must! $3 beers and $4 appetizers. Not a huge selection but awesome eats nonetheless!\n\nCheese fries were ooey gooey and had a generous amount of cheeses! Yes, I said cheeses!!\n\nChicken Strips are thinly coated and very moist. 4 large strips of pure goodness!\n\nMeatballs! 3 large meatballs full of flavor, smothered in marinara sauce and cheese with 4 pieces of garlic bread!! These will please your mouth in ways its never been pleased!"
Four,"My parents live down road and we were in town visiting them, I decided to look on Yelp for something new and different to take them for dinner. We got sat right down with very friendly service. I love older authentic home style places like this. The menu has lots of different offerings with some great choices. They serve warm chips and a couple kinds of salsas and dips (and Hot !). We all got a vast array of choices and the portions were good and tasted great. Everyone told me great choice on picking a new place and I said its all about Yelp! . They checked on us numerous times and kept the drinks full without asking . We always have gone to the other place in town but decided to change and we are very glad we did, If we lived in town we would eat here regularly !"
Four,"""My Saturday morning almost always revolves around walking my pup over to Xtreme Bean for some hot tea and a brief chance to catch up on the news or page through some free AZ periodicals. The experience IS my \morning coffee\"""" and I feel cranky without it.\n\nThe staff is hipster (whatever you take that to mean), the tea selection rocks, the food is tempting (meaning I don't usually go there hungry but I end up wanting a sandwich anyway), and they keep dog biscuits behind the counter. 1-2-3-4 stars. And though I am typically skeptical of all places with a drive thru, it is incredibly fast and convenient when you need a quick Xtreme fix. Kelly and Kona (the dog) approved."""""""
Three,"My husband and I had a late-night itch for some Mexican food, so with the restaurant being so close to the freeway we decided to dine in.  Nice ambience.  Our main entrees were delicious (both got the corn tamal), however we were a little dissapointed that we had to ask the waitress for chips/salsa and for utensils after our entrees were given to us. Overall, the food was delicious - hopefully next time around our waitress and/or host will be a little more prepared."
Five,"Went to Rokerij last night with my out of town son and daughter in law. Had been to Richardsons on a few occasions several years ago.  We were seated at a cozy corner table downstairs. Ordered from the Richardsons side of the menu. Had the ceviche as appetizer and margaritas. Were excellent. For dinner, I ordered stuffed pork chop, corn and garlic chile potatoes. Others had enchides and stuffed chicken. All agreed that the meals were great. Service was quite good, portions were large (we each took some food home) and priced were OK for the quality. All in all, a fine meal."
Four,"This isn't a place that you go a whole lot - but BOY are they helpful when you need them!\n\nI brought in my cordless phone that has some special battery internally that was slowly dying to the point that I could only talk on the phone for about 10 minutes per charge.  Not so fun.  I brought the phone here and the guy was super helpful to find the right battery that would work.  While I was there I saw folks getting batteries for SO many amazing and unique things. \n\nSo if you're looking for something a little more complex than a Duracell AA, you should give them a call.  And even if that's all you think you want - if you're in the area you might want to go by because based on what kind of product you're using it for, I heard them suggest different brands/types of AA battery.  Not something I normally want to think about - but handy to know."
Five,"We bought a Tropitone sling patio dining set here in 2000 and have loved it ever since. Our only regret was that we didn't get a matching sling glider, so last year, we went back to the showroom. They don't make the exact style and color of frame anymore, but the salesman worked with us patiently to find the best match. You have to look REALLY hard to tell it's not from the same exact line.\n\nAlso, we had vouchers for replacement slings on our original set (that we never used because the slings always looked as good as the day we bought them) and they'd expired, but because we were buying the glider and wanted matching fabric, they honored the vouchers! We chose a new fabric that we loved (they have a HUGE selection) and got all 4 chairs re-slung and new hardware put on (because plastic will eventually crack in our harsh, hot summers in AZ) for a reasonable parts-and-delivery fee. They picked up our chairs, put on the new slings and hardware and delivered them back with the new glider, with no problems whatsoever. Everyone was professional, respectful and knowledgeable about the products. The prices quoted were accurate, the time frame for delivery was correct, and we we were thrilled at the quality of the job on the re-slinging.\n\nYes, you can get patio furniture from a warehouse or discount store for much less, but you get what you pay for - the chairs fall apart, the fabric deteriorates, the powder coating flakes off, etc. I highly recommend Paddy O' to everyone I know due to the great selection, excellent service and top-of-the-line products."
Three,"""Always wanted to stop by, and give them a try. Only thing that stopped me were some bad rumors of how clean they are? But then again, how clean is all the places we eat at?? So I had their 8\ Meat Ball sandwich, this was my second choice? I wanted was their cheese steak! But they were out of cheeses steak. But I do not regret their meat ball sandwich. It was very good, wish their bread would have been more toasted. But I thought it was good anyways. Place looks like and feels like a lot like Subway. But I do agree, they do add more meat to the sandwich. I will probably come back again."""""""
Five,"When I want to feel REALLY white, I just roll on down to Ranch Market to confirm my suspicions that, yes, I am in fact not as Hispanic as I think I am.  This store is what Food City WISHES it was!  It takes the best of Mexican specialty stores and eateries and combines it all under one roof.  Shoppers here are mostly Hispanic with a few adventurous gringos thrown in here and there.  But workers there are friendly and know English - some better than others.\n\nHoly crap!  I can't believe it's taken me so long to review this place.  I only go here ALL the time for cheap delicious down-home Mexican food, cheap produce, and Spanish rice like Grandma used to make.  I've been going to Ranch Market for about 10 years at their stores in Bakersfield -- where they first started.  I used to make fun of my mom for going to lunch here.  Heh, look who's laughing now.  I'm addicted!\n\nThe food here is no-frills authentic and seats inside are picnic bench style.  It's not uppity Mexican fare like Barrio Cafe, but it's not Filiberto's diarrhea fare either.  Everything from chile colorado, chile verde, calabasitas, sopes, mole,  tortas, carnitas, chicharrones, tamales, ceviche.  You name it, they have it.   And that's just in the deli.  They have a panaderia with all kinds of cakes, flans and pandulce (sweet bread).  I LOOOVE pandulce.  They even have a jugeria (juice bar) tortilleria, and a counter for fresh cheeses and cremas. \n\nAnd the produce?  Cheap and abundant.  I got some bananas and tomatoes just a little over one dollar.  Don't think about getting any organic veggies here.  This isn't the place.  This is also not the place for low-fat shopping either.  But it is so many other great things that the other stores aren't.\n\nBest of all is the atmosphere inside - it is REALLY festive - like you're at Tia and Tio's fiesta.  Mariachis and bands abound here during the weekend.   Dang!!   Fry's, Safeway, Basha's - take note, por favor.  You're on notice."
Two,"I only give it a second star because I like the atmosphere, seating and cozy/social feel.  I also liked that the waitress walks you through the kitchen to get to your table.\n\nThat was the upside.  Here is the downside.  As you can tell from other reviews it is very pricey.  If you are looking for good Italian kitchen family style food you must go to Maggiano's, 5 star and you get a ton more food for the same price as this joint.  The service tonight was slow and I didn't expect that since we came in after the rush.  The waitress seem experienced but she only pretended to care.  She seem as if she could not be bothered by us even after we introduced ourselves as first time customers.\n\nWe ordered the Chicken Limone and it was very dry.  Enough said.  The spicy chicken (insert your favorite little Italian pasta name here) was pretty good. \n\nMy wife asked what I thought and I said it was okay but I wouldn't exactly come running back."
Two,"""Wow, I'm surprised to see such good reviews on this place.  I thought that the food was mediocre at best.  I had the fez burger (just okay) and my husband had the panko chicken.  They had some interesting flavor combinations on their entrees, but they just weren't executed well.  Everything was really bland.   We ordered the \garlic\"""" fries and boy were they disappointing.  Basically, you're run of the mill fries with garlic powder, yes garlic powder and barely any salt or pepper.  I guess I just assumed that garlic fries would have real garlic, like real restaurants do.  I guess people like this place because it's trendy, but the food doesn't hold up to the atmosphere at all."""""""
Five,"I'm pissed. Now that Man vs. Food has shown my favorite little hole-in-the-wall spot to the world, word is officially out!  I've actually had to -gasp!- wait for a table. Twice. Ugh. ;)\n\nSeriously though - how could someone not love Los Reyes?  They have prompt, courteous service and the food is awesome.  Portions are large, and we always end up with food for the next day.  I love that the waitresses always remember to put extra salsa in the take-out bag.  It is some tasty stuff!\n\nFavorites of ours include:\n\nMexicana Torta\nChicken Tinga Quesadilla del Estilo\nHawaiian tacos - I love pineapple and ham in anything! \nCarne Asada tacos\nLime Agua Frescas\nMango/Coconut Licuados \n\nDo yourself a favor and get yourself down to Sunnyslope to check this spot out.  The prices are ridiculously good, and the food is authentic and just freakin' delicious.  Don't miss it."
Three,"""I like this chain, and this location.  The food options are good, and of course you have those Harkins plastic re-fill cups.  \n\nWhat I am going to attempt on Yelp, is less a review of the theatre and more of a review of the movie(ies) we just saw. Because in the end, they're interchangeable right?  It's all part of the experience. \n\nDecent seats, good selection of what is out there currently, an easy line and a good price.  That's what we look for in a movie theatre.  Since we go to movies two or three times a month, why not share our thoughts of the movie we just saw as well?\n\nBTW, stop in at CafePino's afterwards.

Four,"My coworkers and I tried this place out on a whim one night when we wanted some good Italian cooking, and we successfully satisfied our cravings with Giuseppe's - we totally loved it! Ok, ok, 99% of that could be due to the FREE CORKAGE that they offer (and I'm a sucker for free corkage), but it's also an adorably quintessential, family-owned Italian place that isn't fussy but serves great food.\n\nWe walked into the restaurant (located in a little strip mall - like I said, not fussy) and were seated immediately by a window. It wasn't until we asked for a wine menu and were informed that it was BYOB that we figured out the whole free corkage thing...never one to turn down such an offer, I promptly solicited the help of my PDA to see if I could find somewhere nearby that would sell us a bottle, and thankfully Epicurean Wine & Cafe came to our rescue! They recently opened around the corner on Thunderbird and were more than willing to recommend a good wine for our Italian food, so I gotta give them props - make a stop by here before going to Giuseppe's as they have some unusual California wines that I've rarely seen outside SoCal.\n\nAnyway, for dinner I ordered their tortellini special, which was some chicken pesto with cheese, etc. deliciousness...after I finished I was almost embarrassed at how quickly I ate the entire dish of pasta, but it was just so yummy! It was a dish that just oozed the love that was put into making it. One of my coworkers also ordered the spaghetti, which she said was great as well. Be forewarned, though - they don't accept credit cards, so you might need to stop by an ATM beforehand.\n\nSomehow I have the feeling that anything we could have ordered would have been great...and cheap! I definitely want to come back for another taste!"
Five,"The best sandwich shop in AZ hands down!\n\nIt's all in the bread. Since they make their own bread on-site, it makes your sandwich tasting experience so much better. The aroma and that first bite into your sandwich cannot be put simply. You will need to check a thesaurus to come up with better adjectives to express your experience here.\n\nThe italian focaccia and wheat bread are the best, especially the focaccia. I stand by the staple Dilly Club. They don't short you on meat.\n\nOther greats are the Blazing Buffalo, Dilly Bird and the Vegetarian Special. \n\nAll terrific and delicious. \n\nThis is the kind of place that will have you coming back the same week."
Four,"I went here as part of a business dinner and thoroughly enjoyed myself.  The service was excellent; professional and attentive, without being stuffy or pretentious.  The appetizers, salads, and sides were above average in taste and presentation.  Now, the filet mignon was the highlight of the evening.  The steak was cooked to medium-rare perfection.  If you enjoy a good steak paired with an excellent wine (they have a huge wine list), you should definitely give Fleming's a try.  I'm an out of towner who travels frequently to Chandler and this restaurant tops my list."
Three,"""came here for lunch last saturday and at first i thought it was called \the dump\"""" because thats what it was being referred to. not in a bad way. lol. its a cute place, definitely wasnt crowded at all. in fact we were the only ones in there for a while. service was kinda slow even though we were the only ones in there[there is a sign that even says it is slow because everything is cooked to order] but im talking about like bringing drinks and taking out order, and the waitress has/had a really soft voice at first. their menu is pretty big. i got the mango chicken salad. it wasnt bad but i would have preferred it to not be served on a ton of lettuce that i didnt even eat all of it. \n\nthe restaurant is also an ice cream parlor/antiques store. there is a lot of stuff that you can buy. didn't try the ice cream but the waitress brought us a sample of the apple pie fudge which was to die for!! we might have gotten some but it was hot out and we werent going right home. so all in all i would say to check this place out. its kinda off the wall but i dont really have any complaints. there breakfast menu looked good so i would say that this place is prob best for breakfast?!"""""""
Two,"""When I moved to Phoenix, Pei Wei was one of the first restaurants I went to and one of my go to places for Asian food. However, over the past 7 years, I have found other places I enjoy and would rather dine at. The food is standard and tastes good, but it isn't fantastic. I like that they are doing lunch specials now, so that helps since the portions can be exceedingly large and not great the next day. This location opened up close to work, so it's easily accessible, which is a plus. We came here a few weeks after the grand opening, but it seemed that all the kinks weren't worked out. While waiting in line, there was only one gal on the register and she was ignoring us in favor of folks who just walked in for Take Away. Finally, a Take Away Customer said to her \Aren't you going to help them? They were here first.\"""" She glanced at us, then back to the customer and shook her head no before sighing and finally asking us for our order. Not sure what that was about, but I think they need more employees on the registers, especially at lunch time."""""""
Three,The Daily Dose is a solid brunch spot in Scottsdale. Their was a wait when we went but we quickly seated in a large booth. They have a huge menu and it took me a while to decide what I wanted to order but I went with the breakfast nachos which were absolutely enormous and he went with pancakes. My nachos were eggy and cheesy and yummy came with a gravy on the side which was good for dipping. All in all a solid spot to have a huge brunch or possibly come for after work drinks and food if I lived here.
Five,"Changing Hands.  Probably the greatest bookstore in Metro Phoenix, hands down.  The prices are better than Borders (now out of business) and Barnes & Noble.  \n\nThe atmosphere is fantastic.  Everyone who works here actually wants to help you out.  It isn't like the chain bookstores, where clerks grumble when you ask them for directions.  These people want to make sure you find what you are looking for, and they will pretty much do whatever it takes to make that happen.\n\nWith an added bonus, Changing Hands is connected directly to one of my favorite restaurants, Wildflower Bread Company.  There's nothing better than buying a great new book, followed by a fresh cup of coffee in Wildflower's colorful atmosphere.\n\nAll in all, I find this bookstore to be top-notch.  Remember, if you have some used books that you would like to trade in, then do it here.  You will get some Credit that you can spend on other merchandise in the store... It's the circle of book-life.  :)"
One,"I read a lot of great reviews so we tried it. I was not impressed.\n\nThis is definitely an older crowd (50+) and it seems they cater to that crowd. The food was small portions for the high cost, and the flavors were not all that great. The sweet breads were chopped up and drowned in sauce so you could barely taste the breads. I did not even think they were what we ordered.\n\nI would not spend my money here, especially at their prices."
One,"I'm not one to review concert venues.  But this one I just had to.\n\nThe layout of this place is horrible.  At decent venues, the front-side seats can still see the majority of the act.  Here, the sides are wedged in the corner, not angled toward the stage, making it so those unfortunate people miss the show.\n\nThe TVs didn't have the correct contrast, and in the middle the show they went snowball (like a channel on your TV that you don't get, that white/black fuzzy thing).\n\nIf you have a choice, see your favorite artist elsewhere.  But everyone knows that you don't get to pick, so go ahead and see them here, just sit in the front center."
Five,"This is my second year being a member of the Phoenix Film Society and my second year attending the Phoenix Fim Festival.  I go with a flex pass so each year I see 4 films.\nThis year, I almost didn't attend because I had a ski accident and was told by the doctor to stay home and rest with my leg elevated before my surgery.\nWell, I got bored and decided to do double headers on the last 2 nights before the festival ended.\nI was able to call ahead and reserve my tkts ahead of time which was a big time saver.  On my way to the theater, a volunteer saw me walking with crutches and walked with me, held the door open for me and even sat with me through the movie to make sure I would be okay.\nIn betwn the movie, a volunteer got a chair for me to sit on so I didn't have to walk far while they cleaned the theater in btwn the movies.\nThe second night was the same.  The volunteers were so nice.  One even adjusted my crutches for me because they were not fitted correctly.  In addition, I sat next to a couple who really empathized with my situation~ the husband had just got done with surgery and rehab.  They told me they would bring me his wheelchair and walker for me to use during recovery and sure enough, the hubby brought it by the other day!\nHere I am glowing about the volunteers at the festival and haven't talked about the festival itself.\n. . . this festival is a year long planning event completely run by volunteers . . . for this to happen, the festival itself has to have a lot of heart,  And any event that has a lot of heart, has to be good.  \nI love movies, I love the Phoenix Film Society, and I love the Phoenix Film Festival.  \nI ask that anyone who has attended the festival and had a bad experience to become a volunteer or a member and once you get to know the directors (volunteers) and what it takes to pull a festival of this scale together, then you can better appreciate the existence of this wonderful festival."
Three,"Old Navy, referred to as ON from here on out, and I have a love hate relationship.\n\nIt goes back a long way. A very long way, like over 10 years. We lived in Florida and ON announced they were opening a store and it would be open before school started. Now a few of my friends had been there and loved it, and so we all decided that we would wait to buy our school clothes there after it opened. Well, ON didn't open till like October. So I didn't get new school clothes until then and had to wear the ugly, out of fashion ones for two months. TWO MONTHS! So we started off on the wrong foot.\n\nEver since then, ON  and I have played a game. The game is this: ON has something that looks cute, I try it on, and it either doesn't fit or is way more than what I want to spend. More often than not lately, the clothes have been ugly. And I'd say about 25% of the time, things I try on there actually fit. \n\nSo yesterday I decided to give ON another go. One more time for old time's sake. But like HS so many years ago, it was just another disappointment. While their prices on certain things are definitely cheap, I've gotten wiser as the years have gone on and can't justify spending money on disposable clothes. The things I see online are cute, but I just don't have faith in the fit. \n\nON does redeem itself in two ways. They do sell Tall sizes for Men. Being that my husband is tall, it's a good place to get him t-shirts but they don't carry them in the store, only online. Also, because their children's clothes are cheap, it's a good place to pick up baby gifts or things to spoil other people's babies with. \n\nBut I've given up on finding things for myself. Maybe on day we can reestablish a relationship ON. Maybe one day."
Four,"""Love this joint! A simple margherita pizza is my test for good pizza places. Often, it's the \simplest\"""" dishes that are the most difficult to execute. Classic Italian won't disappoint! This is my East-Valley pick for best pizza. \n\nAlthough they have a full bar, they don't stock Campari. Just a personal taste I have, I suppose. There's not much to brag about the scene. With zero street visibility, no proximity to night life/culture and hidden in an half-empty strip mall, the restaurant must rely on its great  food to sustain business. (not a bad business model... others should take note!)\n\nHit Classic Italian purely for the food and it's an easy winner! Staff is friendly and the pizza is about as good as it gets in the Valley."""""""
Two,"My wife and I recently moved to Scottsdale and have been trying out the breakfast places around town. We decided to try the Breakfast Joynt based on mostly positive reviews.\n\nI can only give this place 2 stars at best. My wife had pancakes which were very heavy, the strawberries were under ripe and butter is served in little plastic tinfoil cups which is pretty lame. Who wants to spend 15 minutes buttering their pancakes?\n\nI had 2 eggs and biscuits & gravy. I seldom order this but there are VERY limited selections on the menu. The biscuits were dry and hard and the eggs were not cooked over easy as ordered but rather the yolks were medium-well. The hash browns were okay.\n\nThe coffee is very weak and not recommended.\n\nOverall, our meal was $25...way over-priced for what we ordered. Also, due to the crowd, we felt rushed by the waitress. I would suggest heading a few miles over to Butterfields-Twice the food, better service and better quality."
Three,"i like lux- there's something about getting my foam in the shape of a leaf that makes me giggly and feel fancy. i also think it's cool that they have a bar but other than that, i can take it or leave it. there's not enough seating and why am i going to sit ouside all year if i can't smoke? i know that's my issue but there are plenty of other coffee shops in phoenix and tempe that have impressed me with their actual drinks and atmosphere"
Five,"Market Bistro is one of my favorite places! Not just in Phoenix, but anywhere. I had to move to CA but whenever I come back to Phoenix I make a point to come to Market Bistro (usually it's the first thing I do!). Their turkey BLT is my favorite thing on the menu, it is absolutely delicious. The paprika mayonnaise is what does it for me! \nThe restaurant itself is nice, good atmosphere and the service has always been good.\nI love this place for the turkey BLT alone and I miss it a lot!"
Five,"I've been going to this Fry's location on a regular basis for over 10 years and I've never had a bad experience. The cashier's are all super friendly, as are the greeters, and courtesy clerks. They almost always have extra lanes open so long lines don't form and the store is very clean. There is also a Wells Fargo inside this location. The unfortunate thing about this location is it is a stand alone store so there isn't any other business's, other than the Wells Fargo, in the shopping center. There is a Walmart, a Jimmy Johns, and a CVS across the street, and they also just put in a Fry's Gas Station. What ever your needs are this Fry's will have it and they'll get you in and out quickly"
Five,"I'm giving this place a 5 because it's one of the best burgers I've had in Phoenix. The real score is somewhere between a 4 and a 5 though. \n\nI truly dig the burger. They clearly use quality meats - in fact, they advertise this. The fries here are fantastic as well. We grabbed this to-go, and the fries were still crispy and perfect. They don't have beer quite yet I don't think, but they will in a few weeks. They do have a really cool assortment of soda bottles though.\n\nI like the concept and the execution. I'm glad this is near my house. The owner and the staff are cool, and I hope this restaurant succeeds."
Four,"I recently visited Cheuvront on a Sunday evening. We were the only people in the restaurant, with the exception of the bartenders and wait staff, so you could definitely say that the service was fast. :) No happy hour on a Sunday evening, but we decided to test it out anyways. \n\nOne whole page of available cheeses, so if you're a cheese connoisseur (not me), this would be pretty exciting. If you're not, it's a bit confusing and overwhelming. We asked our server for suggestions, and we were pleasantly surprised with how knowledgeable he was about the cheese selections. Apparently, all of the cheese are flown in (no sure from where), and then held until they reach the prime age for serving. We ordered the three cheese plate with the Roaring 40's blue cheese, a sharp cheddar, and a Spanish cheese that I absolutely cannot remember the name of. All were delicious and were fantastic recommendations that paired nicely with our wine choices.\n\n We had also heard great things about the macaroni and cheese, so we decided to test them out. They have several variations on this old classic, so we chose to try the Blue Cheese and the traditional. The traditional was delicious- not overly cheesy (both literally and figuratively), and was baked. Yum! \n\nHowever, if you're on a tight budget, I wouldn't recommend visiting outside of Happy Hour. We ordered two glasses of wine, one soft drink, one three-cheese plate, two bowls of macaroni and a lasagna and found ourselves on the receiving end of a $70 bill. \n\nWhile the service and food were delicious, I thought that the price was a bit extravagant for the portion sizes. Overall, I enjoyed my experience, and will definitely return during Happy Hour."
Two,"Disorganized. Disgusting. But friendly, and the price is right.  \n\nSeveral open tables, yet still a 20 minute wait.  Almost as many staff as customers, yet you have to physically grab one of them to get some attention.\n\nMy bananas foster french toast had maybe 10 paper thin slivers of bananas and was swimming in caramel sauce to the point it filled my plate.  It was disgusting.  I kid you not - I literally washed the caramel sauce off my french toast with maple syrup to lighten things up.  Their coffee is just nasty; reminiscent of my grandma's and bad even loaded with cream and sugar.\n\nStaff are some of the nicest people you'd want to be around, unless you're relying on them to serve you breakfast.  Prices are probably the best in North Scotts. for breakfast.\n\nYes, I'd go back.  It's possible they're still settling into the new location, and they seem to have the right attitude to eventually get things running smoothly."
Four,"This is a terrific homewares store!  Great selections of many categories of merchandise.  It ain't cheap, but it's all *quality* stuff. \n\nMost of the people are knowledgeable & happily helpful.\n\nAlmost everything I've bought here is completely satisfying.  On a rare occasion I've taken something back -- they simply replaced it or refunded my money.  No big deal about it.\n\nWhenever I need something along their line, BB&B is where I go first.   Then I don't have to go anywhere else second."
Five,"Why anyone goes to regular movie theatres, I don't know. After going to a place with comfortable seats, food and alcohol, I just can't go back.\nI love the healthy food being available--but ordered the korean tacos and their pizzas are worth trying. The drinks are good- cocktails are just the right amount of strong and their beer has never been stale. Tuesday night special (at least I think its Tuesday) is All You Can Eat pizza, couple that with a pitcher of beer and a good movie and it's a great weekday night."
Five,"Branching more into unknown territories of International foods Burmese has been on my radar since reading about a wonderful place in San Francisco. So when I heard that there was a Burmese place here in the valley well, I got excited.\n\nThe place is awesome! Crossed somewhere between Asian style and Indian style we were all very surprised on how well the food is prepared. We ordered about 13 dishes with our friend (plenty of leftovers) ranging from coconut rice to beef short rib curry. The flavors were great and very unexpected in terms of simple preparation of high quality ingredients. \n\nStandouts were the ginger salad (mixed table side), pork belly curry and the coconut rice. Not only was everything just incredibly tasty but also well priced. \n\nAdd another tasty mom and pop owned restaurant to the valley.. its a real winner!"
Three,"""The sandwiches were good, I'm a big fan of Tortas and it's impeccably clean- huge plus. The major downfall was a young cashier who over charged us on dessert. We both ordered a single scoop of ice cream following dinner and were clearly charged for the double-  a difference of $4 when you add the two- when I politely pointed out that the price seemed off the cashier looked at me and said, \it's the taxes.\""""  Now I'm pretty  unsure about Arizona adding 100% taxes, but he was dead set and did not want to double check. I did the math on my phone, accounting for the 9.1% tax, and it was a far cry from what we were charged. I\n\nThe food was good but I urge you to double check your bill, even though it's a small amount, no one likes to be over charged and under served."""""""
Two,"One word sums this place up. GHETTO! The other reviews were right on the money. I'm not gonna lie, I was scarred! So I suggest buying your tickets ahead of time to get the best rate. I also highly suggest paying the extra 5 bucks to get priority seating and sit up front. And watch your seat- if you leave it empty, you will get jacked.\nBe forewarned- people stink! Apparently other passengers don't believe in showers or deodorant. A can of Lysol may help.\nI'm giving 2 stars instead of 1 because the bus did arrive to destination on time both times I used the bus, and the second driver was very cool and funny."
Four,"I have eaten at Zinburger once before at another location. We were by the Biltmore and hungry....Though the menu is pricey for burgers, it is relatively reasonable for restaurants in the Biltmore. I feel like you are paying for the vibe.....which is fine with me since it really is a cool spot. The server was sharp and attentive and the Carburator burger with an egg on top was just what I needed. YUM! My husband had the Kobe burger and gave it a 4 out of 5. The only negative thing I can say about the place is that they need to eliminate the tables for two with the molded plastic chairs. I get that they have a modern vibe, but no one wants to float out in the middle of a restaurant in an uncomfortable chair while others enjoy the comfort of a banquette...just sayin' ."
Five,"Butter & Me Cupcakery.....What fantastic cakes and cupcakes!!!

I had her make two separate cakes, different occasions, for my wife and my daughter and both came out so wonderful that even those of us that like cakes with the other stuff in them found the taste as good.

Light, eggy, and just YUM for my TUM!  We split the hash browns.  YUM too...  They add their seasoning and just enough flavor to make it different.  \n\nI need to come back to try the other items on the menu..."
Four,"When it comes to higher end quality pizza and pasta in town this is up there on my list. It's mainly getting 4 stars for food quality and lack of wait time. Unlike other well known pizzerias, my wait was just about 2 minutes. Of course if I had opted to eat inside it would have been a bit longer but not by much. I chose the patio, completely shaded and equip with misters I didn't mind not being in the air conditioning. \nAfter looking at the menu for a good while, I decided to build my own pizza, choosing the wild mushrooms, locally made sausage, garlic and spinach. Just having the option to personalize your pizza is nice. The crust is done well and not soggy. I also ordered up their house salad which comes dressed (while good in hind sight I would ask for it on the side) and especially loved the garbanzo bean garnish, such tasty morsels along with several other fresh ingredients. \nThe worst thing about The Parlor is the parking. They offer a complementary Valet but it still ends up being a mess as these guys run all over trying to move and park cars while other people are also trying to find parking, which is limited."
Three,"We have ate her twice in the last 4  months, both times were prior to a D back and Suns game. It is a great spot to stop and satisy your hunger with thier mexican food. Food is good and portions are fair. On both separate occasions, I have to say that their service was extra fast. Both times, we only had enough time to go to the restroom and when we returned, food was at our table. It was the quickest service, which is a huge plus when your trying to get to a game!"
Four,"Sky Harbor International is a unique airport in that the rental car companies are located off premises in a separate building. However, I found that not to be a problem. Sky Harbor provides shuttle buses to the rental car building. The shuttle bus area is well marked and they even have people helping you get on the shuttle buses. Finding Avis Rent A Car was a breeze.\n\nThe Avis counter is well designed and well laid out. If you're a regular Avis customer then you can locate your name on the board and then proceed on downstairs to your rental car. This was my first time with Avis so I had to check in at the counter.\n\nThe counter people were helpful and friendly. As is common in this industry they do all they can to sell you upgrades and extra insurance. However, I always bring along a copy of my auto insurance and I hold my ground about the upgrades.\n\nAfter check in you proceed downstairs to your rental car. If you have luggage you are advised to use the elevator. After seeing a woman and her luggage thrashed on an escalator in Frankfurt airport I can understand this policy.\n\nIn the downstairs area Avis has a coded system to help you locate your rental car. My key was in the car door. A very nice young lady helped me set up my GPS system and gave me directions to my Phoenix destination. Avis has a great web site and a frequent flyer type of program. Fell in love with my rental car and drove away feeling good about Avis Rent A Car."
Five,"OMG!  I am a boba addict.  When I read about Fresco here on Yelp! and saw how close it was to my home, I just had to try it.  I went there and ordered the Bingsoo.  \n\nI asked the gentleman behind the counter if he suggested yogurt or ice cream, and he said yogurt.  I'm not a huge fan of exotic fruits (or berries for that matter) and he told me I could choose 3 fruits and one fruit sauce.  Being the boring fruit eater that I am, I chose banana and double pineapple with strawberry sauce.  And, of course BOBA.  \n\nI asked him if there was a specific way to eat it and he told me to mix it all up.  I did and was in heaven from the first bite.  It was amazingly refreshing, as well as just downright delish.  I will be visiting this place regularly on the weekends for a bingsoo fix, but this morning I will try their milk tea with, of course ... BOBA!\n\nI HIGHLY recommend this place.  5 stars for sure!!!"
Three,"You know, I never understood why Parrotheads get so excited about Jimmy Buffet.  After my first visit to Margaritaville... I still don't understand. I get it, it's a way of life or state of mind, a way to cut loose... but continuous videos of tailgating at Jimmy Buffet shows, with Chesney or Wilson thrown in every 10th video? Not for me. I'm sure a lot of people find this place to be like a little 'cheeseburger in paradise'. The atmosphere is kind of fun, but with a quoted 'one to two hour wait time', at a place that will not do reservations or call-ahead seating, it would be nice to have bigger bars to kill that wait time. The food is not bad. I will say the Volcanic Nachos were like manna from heaven, after we got seated, stacked THIIIIIS high with lots and lots of 'penos. My fish tacos were nothing to write home about, and the side of 'paradise' or something of that nature rice was... rice with carrots and peas. Huh. I have to say, though, I did not feel ripped off. The food wasn't stellar but at $10 for a good-sized helping, it was decent. My friends ordered other things and I really did not hear any raving. One person's steak was still mooing, after ordering it medium. \n\nService was really, really good. I wish I could do a separate 4 stars for the staff, they were awesome. I never had to ask for another drink, and our guy was incredibly patient while we waited for the rest of our party to show up after we had been seated. We did not feel rushed at all, and that means a lot in such a packed restaurant where others are obviously waiting still. They split our check without batting an eyelash. I tipped accordingly, you should too. These guys were facing a mosh pit with smiles on their faces. The balloon guy on stilts was a hoot (ask him to give you crabs if you go) and the live band was classic college alt rock, about 5 years after college. No one danced, which I thought was pretty funny. They didn't sound too bad. \n\nDefinitely a place for Parrotheads or those into doing the trendy theme restaurant thing. :)"
One,"Rarely do I give a 1 star rating but after four attempts in four months to get my fax line and internet rolling I can honestly say they have earned this.  After finally showing up for a scheduled appointment the tech told us our internet was fine but we disagree because we are getting the same speed we had with Qwest in Cave Creek (SLOW)  and they are charging us $64 a month for what they call the upgraded 20mbs.  Furthermore, I tried to send out a couple faxes after he left and the line is not responding.  Im going to drive down to the store tomorrow and demand that they remove the fees for service I have not received and just get efax.  As I noted in the first review we were excited to upgrade to faster internet so that makes this experience even worse."
Four,"This place is great! I work up the street and it's a nice place to come sit after work... I usually get the Steak Salad, it's a perfect size and delicious. Also get the falafel appetizer it's excellent, very filling tho... The place is a bit pricy, but its DC Ranch so i cant blame them. One of their secret things are the Sweet Potato chips, warning: they are addictive, can never eat less than a bag. There's two others that I know of, seems like they got a good little system going on, the one in Old Town is also very nice. Enjoy!"
Four,After a morning hike we returned to the resort for some food.  We decided to come here since it was close to the clubhouse so my fiance could golf the gold course.  We sat outside and it was very peaceful- they had a lot of umbrellas to keep your area shady.  \n\nWe ordered the flatbread to start- which was just ok.  My friend and I split the cobb salad and turkey club.  Very good but the bun was super greasy.  My fiance had the burger.  I liked that the chef uses a lot of fresh and locally grown products.  The fries were really good and tasted fresh too. \n\nOne cool thing I liked (kinda random) was there are tv screens in the mirrors within the bathroom...ha.  I think this would be a nice place to go after or before golfing.  It seems like the outside you can get away with wearing whatever you want but inside it looked to be a little more fancier... my gym shorts and sweaty t-shirt didn't really fit the dress code for inside.
Five,"Love Salon Switchblade!  Melinda is great and always has creative ideas to share.  She is edgy and on point with all of her recommendations whether you want to keep it simple or get a little crazy!  She is also willing to explain and teach you things if you aren't a pro at styling your own hair or have questions about something she's doing, she's patient and offers explanations along the way. \n\nI found out about this place from an old college friend I would bump into occasionally out and about.  She always had the most stylish hairdo and gorgeous color.  I finally asked her where she went to get it done and she raved about Melinda and handed me a card.  I booked an appt immediately and am very happy I did!  \n\nI definitely recommend Melinda and Switchblade Salon to anyone looking for good options in the Cen Pho!"
Three,"The best place to skip work and goofy golf in the spring and summer. Sure, it's a little musty, old, run-down... but it's a slice of my childhood and at least it's still here. \nI can't gather the courage to ride the roller coaster anymore and bumper cars just aren't as appealing as they once were but the two story arcade still makes me squeal a little.\nThe golf is great too! I would suggest playing courses one through three. The last two times I've been we played course four and three and four has the least amount of attractions. Courses one and two are busiest, so it's a choice between being stuck behind a bunch of kids or some really un-fun holes.\n\nOh, and they do have a black and white photo booth."
Two,"yet another groupon try... \nThey have a HUGE menu, which excited me greatly, upon first gaze, however the results weren't so great. I had the Mama Leone. The bread was kinda gummy, the meats were ok, but there sure wasn't much to this sandwich.. it was supposed to be hot, but it was just lukewarm, and the marinara sauce was also cold. Yuck. \nAlso, the Little Italy Salad was served not-as-described by the menu (they didn't include croutons, or onions.. it was just lettuce, tomatoes, and meat. that's it!).  Finally, the dining area is cluttered, and needs to be de-crumbed."
Five,"Absolutely wonderful. I wish I could give them 10 stars. They were that good. I am really picky when it comes to piercing shops and I usually stick to my main one but that one is 1,000 miles away so when one of the studs on my nape piercing came out, I decided to come here. Man am I glad I did. I walked in and was greeted right off the bat. The guys that worked there were honest, friendly, personable, and knowledgeable. I don't think I have ever been that comfortable in a shop before, even at the one I frequent regularly. JD was freaking wonderful. I had to take a significant amount of clothes off for the piercings I got and not once did I feel uncomfortable. He was very meticulous with the placement of the piercings so they would be perfect, which they are. And they are AFFORDABLE. The shop I went to back home was a great shop but it was really expensive. I will definitely be returning to this shop, not only to get pierced again, but to hang out with the totally awesome dudes that work there."
Five,"I was very happy with my recent stay here. The rooms were clean and comfortable, the staff was all helpful and friendly, and the lobby was cool. They have water and coffee available all day for free, plus a Starbucks/breakfast and light dinner place that isn't too expensive. The hotel has a modern feel and you end up meeting people in the lobby to hang out and eat breakfast because they have lots of seating (booths, tables, chairs, free Internet stations, and two computers available to print out boarding passes). There is an outdoor pool in the courtyard and they have a little firepit at night to sit by, too, with comfy chairs and couches. I was impressed by the people at the front desk who were always willing to recommend restaurants and gave us rides in the shuttle to and from the airport, and any time they weren't busy, they would drop us off at a nearby downtown area, too."
Five,"""Piestewa and Camelback Peaks are the two boobs of Phoenix. They're real, and they're spectacular. \n\nOf course, being all-natural one is just a slight bit larger than the other, but this is barely noticeable. Camelback is barely 100 feet higher than Piestewa, whose nipple... er... summit, is at 2608 feet. Climb either one and you can enjoy great views of the other at various vantage points, not to mention views of the city. \n\nAlthough Camelback strikes me as a funner climb, I give Piestewa 5 stars because for what it lacks in the intangible fun factor it makes up with being just a tad less insanely crowded. Piestewa Peak Park also has a number of really cool looking trails that don't go up to the summit, which look to me to be worth exploring some day.\n\nSpeaking of female body parts, the former name for this peak was \Squaw\"""" Peak. This has inspired one of the most ridiculous controversies in modern times in our state. Native Americans are offended by the term \""""Squaw\"""", and regardless of the linguistic origins of the word, it is basically the equivalent of terms such as \""""Negress\"""" or \""""Jewess\"""". In the 1990s, the State of Arizona proposed ending the controversy by renaming the peak after our greatest political leader ever and the father of American conservatism, Barry Goldwater. The whining dipshits who apparently constitute our voting population rejected the idea. They'd rather continue using a stupid name that has no historical or sentimental value whatsoever just to spite Native Americans, rather than honoring one of their finest citizens.\n\nAnd so, in this decade, Democratic Governor Janet Napolitano put an abrupt end to the whole issue. She gave the sqaw-apologists the finger and ordered the renaming of the peak to Piestewa, after Lori Piestewa, the first US woman soldier to be killed in the 2003 Iraq war and a member of the uniquely-Arizonan Hopi Nation. A fitting end to the debate.\n\nNOTE: Even more fitting, the original name of this peak was Squaw Tit Peak, and I swear to God I'm not making that up to be funny."""""""
Four,"""This is a dive I don't mind stumbling into. Behind the run-down exterior is a dark, smoky room full of NASCAR ads and drink specials. $2.50 Coors and Coors Light bottles at all times...in fact, I think every domestic bottle is. My co-worker and I got some rum and cokes ($2.75) and they knocked us off our feet. With only a shot left in her bottle, the bartender approached me mid-drink and said \Well I can't waste this...\"""" I like their style. There were some bottles of less popular liquors on sale, including a liter of Lunazul Blanco for $10. That's probably a steal, but honestly, do you think I can be trusted with that much tequila?\n\nNo ATM, cash only. Snacks are limited. This bar defines \""""dive\""""."""""""
Five,"I was lured into this gallery by the vibrant colors and good fun that it's walls emanate. The clincher for me was a painting of two monkeys and a paper airplane hovering over the pair. Upon catching a glimpse of that scene, I had to walk through this gallery's doors and be part of the fun. \n\nI stress the word fun when it comes to this gallery because so much art is serious. There's nothing wrong with serious; some art should be serious. The world, more so, needs serious art. It's refreshing, however, to see more whimsical work on display. Wilde Meyer does not offer a lower caliber of fine art, but rather another degree of excellence to the fine art world. Check it out!"
Two,"Pretty average place. Small menu. Nothing too exciting. I totally missed the Sonoran Hot Dog until after I had ordered, so I may goo back and give it a try.\n\nWe had the flautas and fish tacos. Both came with refried beans and rice. Just unimpressive all around. The beans and rice didn't taste very fresh. Not terrible, just cheap. Same with the guacamole.\n\nOne thing did shine, though. The chips and salsa were great. They give you a huge plate of chips and a tub of salsa. The chips taste homemade and were lightly salted, just right.. The salsa was excellent. Great kick! A little on the watery side, but hard to complain when it's so good.\n\nUnless you just have to have a Sonoran Hot Dog, I'd say you can skip this place."
Two,"First the good: we came in a larger party and they seated us in a very convenient area. The restaurant was nicely appointed with comfortable seating. The servers are friendly. \nThe bad: it took almost an hour to get our food and the entrees were all really greasy. Don't get me wrong - greasy can be ok but not when you're ordering an egg white omlett. \nThey don't have a baby changing station. A breakfast place should have this. So we had to change a poop diaper on the tables bench seat. Since we were in a corner no one could see but there was no other place and the car wasn't an option because it was already 107 F out. As a new father out for fathers day breakfast, this seemed to rank as a rookie mistake. Put a changing table in the restroom. \nI would not recommend this place because the food just wasn't good."
Three,"Sure the place has atmosphere and a good drink menu, but I prioritize the eats. \n\nWe went on a Monday night for a friend's birthday with a semi-large group and they did a prixe-fix menu. I left hungry after paying more than the meal deserved. \n\nThe bad: Shumai was just ok, duck mint salad had an unharmonious flavor and I refused to eat it, chicken with wasabi sauce was dried out, lychee wrapped bacon was soggy and a strange proportion, cream and goat cheese dessert with peach was not fun. \n\nThe good: the Hong Kong rice noodles and fried tofu with pinapple sauce were the highlights and only things I would eat again. They were really tasty. But I won't be eating them again, because I don't plan to go back. \n\nI'm sure there's some gems here, as we found a few, but I need a better batting average and, oh, I dunno, to leave full with a few bucks left in my wallet?"
Five,"""OK, went back to NOCA again a few nights ago (Saturday) with two other couples. The place was packed and the vibe was good. I had a better chance to look over the wine list, and I was most impressed with NOCA's seclection of \Leonetti\"""" from Washington State. For those who aren't familiar with it, Leonetti is HIGHLY ALLOCATED and considered one of the best wones in the United States...if you can find it. This is pricy juice, but it was cool to see it on the list. I told Eliot to get a hold of some \""""Quilceda Creek\"""" and now we are talking!\n\nWe ended up ordering the Helen Turley Zin, which was excellent with a spicy but round finish.\n\nOur waiter Frank was very helpful and recommended a Tortellini pasta appetizer for the table, along with the Sea Urchin. All were very yummy indeed, with a superb melding of layered flavors.\n\nLet me segue to dessert if I may - the cotton candy this particualr night was friggin the best ever...Green Apple! Wow, everyone loved it and the flavor was melt in your mouth good.\n\nWe also ordered the homemade donuts with the three sauces - unbelievable! Our table felt the best sauce was the Strawberry, followed by the Dulce Le Leche and then the chocolate.\n\nThe Chocolate Chip cookie with the malt was good, but most agreed not up to the high bar that the donuts achieved...the cookie was a little too cloying and sweet, and the malted shake that comes with it was probably better by itself as a standalone.\n\nAll in all, NOCA is still heaven in a strip mall."""""""
Five,"My husband and I checked out Oliver and Annie this past weekend. We found the place to be so friendly and charming. We were greeted right away by the owner (I think he was the owner) and he was so helpful and knowledgable. He pointed out many items and gave us the background on the items. \n\nWe found so much great stuff for our cats. We only picked up some treats to give to the cats, but I plan to go back and try out some more items. \n\nSome of their products can be a tad pricey, but I'm sure worth it as most products I looked at were all organic, SLS free, hand made, locally made... and look, I'm a frugal person, so I'm always looking to save a few pennies, but for the health of my cats I will spend the extra bucks on the products at Oliver and Annie.\n\nI found so much I wanted to buy for my cats, but was kind of on a budget, so I'll have to go back and stock up on shampoo and toys for my feline friends.\n\nChris, the owner (who is totally awesome by the way) was saying how they take in kittens and clean them up and do adoptions. I thought that was so awesome and made me happy there was a store like this and people like this that care so much about animals."
Four,"My boyfriend had raved about this place for awhile so back when Phoenix Restaurant Week rolled around and Fogo de Chao was featured as one of the participating restaurants a group of us gathered together to go experience a Brazilian steakhouse. \n\nIt was packed, which was to be expected as usually this place is on the pricey side, and I think there was some problem with our reservation but it was sorted out and we were seated in short order. \n\nNow I was just here for the meat but after some prodding I decided to do a loop around the salad bar so I could say I experienced everything. Man, what a salad bar! They had everything from fruits to and veggies and the regular old salad with lots of dressing options to meats and cheeses and whatever else you could possibly want. \n\nWhen you're ready for the meat to come to you, you flip over a little round card that is given to every place at the table. Red means no, green means come at me boys! This signals the servers walking around with skewers of different meats to stop by and ask if you'd like a slice. The answer is always yes yes yes! I tried to try one of everything and between the chicken, steak, pork, and lamb I had a menagerie of animals on my plate. Everything was succulent and juicy and the best part was with some of the meats you could tell them how done you wanted it and they would flip to the appropriate section to slice you off a piece. \n\nThere is of course a moment when a lady decides that there is simply too much meat to fit into her mouth anymore and with some reluctance I flipped my card around to red to stop my stomach from bursting. \n\nThe cherry on top of this sundae was that our restaurant week flat price included a choice of one of three desserts and it was delicious. \n\nI would definitely recommend this place to those of you wanting to try something new and the price point makes it a great special occasion restaurant. (I know where I want to go on my upcoming anniversary!)"
Three,"If you're looking for antiques with a New Orleans / French vibe, then Sage is the place for you.  The store features a rotating inventory of architectural salvage.  Lots of the items come from Missouri and the buildings in St. Louis offer up great French-inspired salvage. \n\nThis is also a great place for vintage lighting (but it has nowhere near the inventory of vintage lighting that you will find at Stuff Antiques).  One day I happened into Sage after the owner had just hung a vintage 1920s Murano French Art Deco chandelier from her neighbor's dining room.  I bought it on the spot and it's got pride of place in my entryway.\n\nThe store also features a variety of tchochkes, some of which are interesting.  It's worth a visit as some intriguing religious items have also appeared over time.  \n\nThis is definitely the place where you come for cool stuff to find you rather than a store you visit to find a specific item."
Five,"My husband and I have made this restaurant one of our frequent dining spots. Not only are the bruschetta planks fantastic (MUCH better in my opinion than a popular, more snooty wine cafe restaurant praised in Phoenix.) The prosciutto and truffle oil plank is my favorite, and the use of heirloom tomato's whenever they are in season is a very nice, and tasty touch. Drinks are excellent and fresh, and the staff has always been friendly. \n   My favorite part though, is the cozy, unpretentious atmosphere. From college students to working professionals, you really won't feel out of place whether you're in casual-wear or gussied up for a date. \n   If you are coming here expecting to be surrounded by the plastic of Scottsdale and the attitude to match, you will probably be dissapointed. But, if you are looking for a cozy relaxing place to enjoy a meal, or go on a date, this is a perfect spot."
Five,"People the world over have set aside Sunday as a time to fulfill religious obligations in a church or a temple or whatever. I, too, devote Sunday to a spiritual undertaking of sorts. Brunch: the most important of all Sunday traditions, and Gallo Blanco is one of my favorite houses of worship.\n\nI begin my service with a holy communion of mimosas. I reflect on the salvation that the blood of distilled grapes and fresh squeezed flesh of oranges provides to me. \n\nThen the divine Huevos Rancheros speaks to me through a chorus of heavenly flavors. The housemade tortillas, perfect blend of cheeses, and spicy tomato sauce brings me to my knees in a prayer of thanksgiving.\n\nThe saints that staff this wonderful establishment are very helpful and attentive. They are always happy to bring out an additional round of mimosas or to explain any menu item. \n\nI will religiously attend brunch at Gallo Blanco because their food is amazing, and the wait is not as bad as other brunch hotspots around downtown.\n\nAmen!"
Four,"Mom and Pop place that is delicious.  A fan of their drunken noodles.  They will ask you hot spicy you want your curries.  If you brave good for the spice, you can always quence your thirst with a Thai tea.  The Satays are delicious and the portions of all meals are plentiful.  I usually have enough for anotehr meal.  The decor is nice but they do have these oddly large tables.  Go with a big group and order lots!  They also have lunch specials which are really reasonable."
Four,"Veterans Oasis Park is a nice oasis out in southeast Chandler.  There are several nice ponds with fishing, picnic shelters, paved and gravel trails as well as off trail hiking and a water feature.\n\nPart of the park is a hill rising perhaps 150 feet above the surrounding desert.  Near the top a stream erupts from the ground and flows down to the size able fishing pond.  This provides a nice place to cool your feet after a nice walk/hike or as I like to do, get a nice workout hopping from rock to rock up and down the length of the stream."
Two,"""This Walmart has implemented the \electronics merchandise has to be paid for IN electronics\"""" system, which would probably cut down on theft and just be generally convenient for people buying one or two things and not wanting to wait in the horrendous lines up front. The only problem with this is the fact that the second shift employees in electronics are completely inept.\n\nI stood next to the register yesterday with an ink cartridge for about ten minutes watching a female associate flirt with a customer. Finally, I tried to get her attention, and she flat out ignored me. Then I just went up front with my ink cartridge. \n\nAfter that incident I was looking for a roll down patio shade in the garden center, and every associate in that department looked terrified at the idea of being asked a question when I approached them. Also, none of them even knew what a patio shade was or if they stocked them. Finally the garden center cashier understood my question, and told me they did not carry them, so I went on to Home Depot as I should have done in the first place."""""""
Four,"First time at Zinburger; had a party of 4 on Friday; had to wait about 15 minutes; just what the hostess had said, I like that!!!  Now, the food; simple menu; but I got the speciality the Zinburger, but got mushrooms instead of grilled onion; delicious - it was cooked to perfection.  One of  my friends got the Samburger, he really seemed to enjoy it.  Another friend got the turkey burger; someone that has been to Zinburger before and told us what sides to order; devoured his turkey burger in no time flat.  Our other friend who only eats fish had the Ahi Sandwich; really enjoyed it.  The sweet potato fries & double truffle fries were awesome.  Also, split the banana creme pie between the 4 of us - YUMMY.  The service was great.  I will be back."
Four,"I have to say that since the new ownership this place has raised the bar!..(no pun intended)..the renovations that have been done are fantastic. New sound system, floor tile, ceiling tile, ceiling fans, millwork on the walls, kudos to Doug & Michael as they are sparing no expense here. Still great karaoke on Friday nights as well as Saturday. Trish, Kitty & Josh still pouring great drinks at resonable prices. The karaoke on Friday nights is a blast and the bartenders getting in on the karaoke makes it that much more fun. If you have not been to The Rock in the past 4 months, you need to go and check out whats been happening there."
Three,"Great hip hop bar with an extremely diverse crowd. There were everything from b boys to crackers in this place. The DJ was good and spun some interesting music (happy to hear de la soul and tribe) plus they had some good local talent hip hop. Its a cash only bar but the drinks are very cheap so its not a huge deal and they also have an ATM on site incase you run out of paper. I ventured into the other side of it, and was kind of frightened. The flourescent lights were on, there was no music, and it was a friggin hole. Only thing that wasn't cool about the hip hop side is the female bartender that works there. 3 girls I was there with got kicked out, because one of them had an expired ID, not fake, expired. I figured after the doorman scrutinized it and let her in, the bartender should be ok with it. She kicked all 3 of them out because she deemed they were together, and why she let me stay (wasn't drinking) is beyond me. \n\n4 stars -1 for the crazy bartender.\n\nAlso please ignore the couple of reviews that say they take CCs for tabs. As of May 26th, they stopped doing this... Don't trip they say."
Five,"Best green chile tamales I've ever had (though I have not eaten too many tamales)!  And only $1.30 each!  I revisited the bakery to buy a 1/2 dozen more!  Tamales I've eaten in the past have been dry and flavorless- these are the total opposite- moist and packed w/ pork and masa.  Flavorings were just right for me- not spicy but still flavorful.\n\nI also tried 3 different empanadas- queso, guava & mango- all delicious and $.65 each. Flaky crust with oozy filling.  \n\nLike another Yelper said, they could have totally charged more- it was pretty empty & quiet when I stopped in here (middle of a weekend afternoon) so they may be busier at other times.  The lady behind the counter was very patient with me, as I asked her what everything was and pondered over what to purchase."
Four,"Spring is in the air and there is no better time to get your herbs and veggies planted for the summer harvest. So after last years heirloom tomato disaster we decided to do something with a yield, so Harper's it is. \n\nClose to the house, locally own, well priced, friendly and great selection. While they do not stock heirloom varieties, we did find some nice beefsteaks that so far have about a dozen fruits growing on them. \n\nCan not wait to see how many we get!! Yummy pico de gallo, BLT, caprese, salted, chopped and loved!"
Five,"Fantastic Italian food.  Simple elegant menu, consisting mostly of pasta, which in this case, is a good thing.  They claim to make the pasta in-house and it shows.  The pastas are delicate and delicious.  All of the sauces have a richness of flavor and complexity that seems to come only from the fine-tuning of several generations of family chefs.  There are many more elegant dishes, but I prefer the lasagna most of all.  It is melty and rich and hearty, all without being too heavy.  A classic soul-food done to perfection.\n     It is moderately expensive, with entrees that run from 16-25 dollars.  In any other city this would seem a little too expensive, but in Scottsdale it's practically a bargain.  The restaurant is very comfortable inside, but it is hidden in a strip mall.  Don't let the location fool you, the food really is fantastic, even if it's neighbors are a dairy queen and a hair salon."
Four,"Great atmosphere, service and food.  But I found out it is closing in two weeks.  \n\nI get together with 7-8 friends each month at a different foreign food restaurant and we thought let's try Israeli this month.  there was the typical falafil, hummus, etc. but then there is Russian Potato Salad and Schnitzel which was amazing!  Yummo...  As a group we eat everything family style so got 5 entries and 4 appitizers.  Each main entry was served with rice, roasted carrots with chick peas and green beans stewed with tomatos.  More food than we could eat so got to take home leftovers. \n\nBaklava was ok - a bit dry for my taste.  But I loved their mint iced tea, the waitress was so sweet and told us how they made it.  Just brew dried mint leaves and pour over ice.  \n\nSo I'm glad that I finally got to experience this restaurant but very sad to see it go."
Four,"""OK this is some very good Mexican food.  Totally above average to excellent!!  Finally got to get over there as it is a bit of a drive across town, but I am so glad I did.\n\nNot too much to add as the other reviews are spot on.  Very clean and cute, but a bit different.  For one they play some really good Latin style jazz overhead which I really liked.  Also the fresh juices and ice cream were behind the glass counters and it all looked very fresh!\n\nSeems to be a mother son operation, and the mother who cooks was very friendly and told me right away that everything was \home made\"""" and it really was.\n\nGot the carne asada tacos plate, and a side of guacamole.  All the flavors were great, I really loved their guacamole, very fresh.  You could taste all the ingredients.  Even the rice and beans (which I usually don't even eat because at most places they are so bland and obligatory) tasted really good!   Oh the tacos were perfect too!\n\nI was really impressed with the overall quality of the food, and will totally be back on a Saturday as I don't live close by, but if I did, I would be there once a week for sure.  I am already craving that guacamole.\n\nEven the lemonade was great!  Next time a little desert perhaps?\n\nOverall, very clean, friendly, with some well above average offerings.  \n\nIf only most other little Mexican food places were this good, think what a better World this could be?\n\nViva Sonora Mesquite Grill!\n\nMost likely will be upgraded to 5 stars after one more visit.

Four,"We had a fun, early dinner on the patio here at BoomBozz.  The advertised happy hour specials appeared to be a very good value; my fave was the soft pretzels & cheese.  I also had the wedge salad and it was excellent - they don't skimp on the blue cheese!  My son had the pepperoni pizza and even his discriminating palate was very happy.  A crisp blonde draft (for me) and ice cream (for him) polished us off and we left full & happy."
Five,"Milk is for babies.\n\nI have been purchasing my package beer from here for a while, so I think I should impose my view on this beer universe.\n\n-Abbaye de St Martin. Brewer is Brasserie De Brunehaut, Belgium. 11.2 fl oz, 9% $5.\nPoured in to a tulip glass shows a dark brownish hue. Tastes starts up nice with a lot from the aroma.

On this spot in St-Remy we were received. Or we are monk or just pass-by, here we are not at home, but with God. The monks have the duty to make this spot beautiful and harmonious. The passer-bys can enjoy the beauty of what it means, to feel God among us. Since the foundation in 1930, the abbey has, through the ups and downs of the ages, known a rich history. This history we can summarize in a few words. Men who leave everything behind to live with God and in that way open the eyes for the Ressurection of the Lord. Saint Benedict has introduced this principles in the VIth century by means of a rule which is observed till today.\n\nPoured into a Trappistes Rochefort Goblet. Hazy dark brown almost the same color as a beer bottle. Lots of sweet caramelized brown sugar, over ripe dark fruits, belgian yeast, slightly boozy. Exceptionally built, subtly complex.

Three,"After years of driving right past this place, I finally am stopping by for dinner.  For my Mom's birthday.  \n\nUnfortunately, our experience didn't start out too well.  We had called ahead for a reservation but they don't take any.  But the girl assured us that it was hardly crowded and there shouldn't be more than 15m of a wait, especially if we came by soon.  Great! We would be there in less than 30 minutes.\n\nWHOA! did things changes in that little time.  I walked in and found out that not only was it PACKED,  there was a 40 minute wait.  And that really soured me on the experience, because I felt a little duped.  But I guess it is possible that a mass of people showed up in 20 minutes.  It happens......(not really).\n\nBut otherwise, the meal was pretty good!  The pizza is super good, with a wonderful thin crispy crust.  I can't believe I had never been to this place before.  I will need to come back for sure!\n\nAnd apparently, they don't offer anything fun for your birthday.  We mentioned that it was my Mom's birthday, in passing, and the waiter shrugged it off.  He did give us a card that she could fill out for her next birthday to get a free pizza. Who remembers the coupon 1 year later?  Pretty lame."
Two,"I just don't get it.  Why would you pay such a high price for such a mundane and uninspired sandwich?  I had the garlic chicken (which wasn't very garlicky and just seemed like glorified chicken salad) sandwich and really wasn't impressed.  I also opted for a ridiculously priced Greek salad- coming out to over five bucks for eight ounces.  It just wasn't amazing in any stretch of imagination, and nowhere near the money it cost.\n\nThe actual building is of some interest.  I enjoy that you can eat upstairs and they'll clip your sandwich to a sack and send it up to you.  The front patio was inviting.  However, the layout doesn't really lend itself to an efficient order.  The nonalcoholic drinks are set in the back, while the alcohol is set in another room entirely.  The bathrooms are pretty much like a public park restroom- and just as dirty.  \n\nI understand that it is locally owned and has somehow been voted best sandwich for something like thirty years, but eh, unless you're craving an overpriced, and ordinary sandwich... I'd skip it."
Four,"""Somebody please tell me why QT is the best gas station/convenience store ever?\n\nThe layout is the same for every one. The bathrooms are always less gross than other convenience stores. The service is always phenom. Gas is usually relatively cheaper than other stations in the area. Plus its like a one stop shop for emergency \got to have it now\""""s like snickers and chicharones and energy drinks and milk and wipies right? Hahaha!\n\nI don't know. My yelp told me to write a review... =D"""""""
Four,"""A friend took me to dinner for my birthday at this location this week.\n\nThe food was great.  I rarely eat ribs, but think they have some of the best here.  The meat falls of the bone.  The sauce is just about right, tangy but not to strong.  A plus to the bartender as well, he knows how to mix a good ginger ale.\n\nI want to recommend Rachel,our server, to anyone who goes to this location.  Here is a young woman who really knows how to do her job.  The service she provides is acceptable in every way so I can't complain.  She also did something very special that proves she really listens to her customers when she does her job.\n\nMy friend I went to dinner with is 91 with Alzheimer's.  With this illness, this could be our last time she gets to celebrate my birthday with me so it really was important to me that things went well.  She let Rachael know that for my birthday she wanted a cake served with a candle.  I tried to explain to my friend, Norma, that they didn't do that at this restaurant which I know disappointed her but what could I say.  After finishing a full rack of ribs,  I could use the excuse that I was to full to have a desert so could get around the cake and candle situation.  At this point Rachael asked me if I was ready for my birthday desert and expressed that she thought I'd really enjoy it and she gave Norma a big smile so I said fine.  I couldn't believe it when she came out with a scoop of ice cream with a candle in it.  This delighted Norma and touched my heart as Norma sang Happy Birthday\ to me.  This is service ask for Rachael!  She get's five stars!\n\nThere is only one thing I could suggest that would improve my experience at Outback.  I think the bring out the entree a bit sooner than I would like after the salad is served.  A little more time in between would be nice."""""""
Three,"""We have been going to Eastwind for years. Two months ago I would have given it 4 or maybe even 5 stars. But certain changes recently are bumping down my rating.\n\nThe good\nMost of the food is delicious. My favorite is the vegetable tempura soup. Their happy hour is extremely affordable. Very cheap sake bombers. My husband likes the sushi rolls on happy hour. I'm not a fan of the vegetarian choices for happy hour. The sweet potato fries aren't very good. They don't have any veggie rolls on special for happy hour (c'mon veggies are cheaper than fish!) so I end up ordering my favorite roll, the veggie tempura roll, off the menu. It is always super tasty. The servers are sooo nice. They can be a little slow and forgetful when the restaurant is busy but they are too nice and genuine to get mad at them.\n\nThe bad\nAs I mentioned I usually order the veggie tempura roll for happy hour, even though it is not happy hour priced. Well, one roll isn't enough for me to get filled up so up to 2 months ago, I would order a side of PLAIN fried rice. Their fried rice is yummy. It was only about a cup full but it was perfect accompaniment to one veggie roll. Last time we went in for happy hour I tried ordering my usual veggie roll and SIDE of fried rice. The server looked at me with guilty eyes and said \Oh, we can't do that anymore.\"""" He said if I wanted to order fried rice I would have to order the $8 fried rice entree. The fried rice entree has an option of chicken or beef, which is probably why it is a whopping 8 bucks. I'm a vegetarian who just wants some damn fried rice without any meat but I am not going to pay $8 for just rice. The server said the manager put an end to the restaurant offering it as a side. Talk about nickel and diming! How cheap can you get? It's RICE! Apparently, the manager made a couple of other changes that the staff and patrons are not crazy about. \n\nUnfortunately, these small changes are making a huge impact on how often we will patronize Eastwinds. We might need to find a new sushi happy hour place..."""""""
Four,"Random area. Must be a converted home back in the day in central Phoenix.\n\nWhat I was impressed with was the table side guacamole. It was absolutely delicious. The waiter made some crazy concoction and the secret ingredient of pomegranate seeds added. Gives is texture and a sweetness to the guacamole. Absolutely genius.\n\nThe sangria was amazing as well. They serve it with a shot of Jack Daniels and it tastes like juice.\n\nFinally the churros are soooooooo delicious. Who doesn't like fried lard sticks dipped in cinnamon and sugar filled with caramel?!!! Dude, move over Disneyland churros and Costco churros, this is your bling bling cousin!!!\n\nMy entree- some halibut, was lack luster. I didn't enjoy it as much as it was hyped up to be. Presentation of it looked like something that came out of a buffet line- messy and uninspired.  Tried a nibble of the famous 16 hour pork as well and I was underwhelmed.\n\nIn conclusion- come here for perhaps a snack? They were incredible."
Four,"I am currently dog sitting for a girlfriend of mine here in awatukee.  I've known about this park for a while, and took the dog to check it out for the first time.\n\nI really wavered between 3 and 4 stars on this.  I'm giving the park the benefit of the doubt, since it is a park, and I wish all neighborhoods could have a dog park available to them.  Where I grew up, we had parks for kids, but there was no designated dog park area.  Having an accessable dog park in the area is such a luxury to me, and I think its amazing and wonderful.\n\nAnyways, the park is simple.  Fenced grassy area, stinky water area, one bench area for shade and thats it.  Heres where my disappointment sets in.  I have been to other dog parks in the city of Phoenix, and seen a lot bigger and better jobs having been done.  I think they should have had a better water area for starters.  It was a spicket with a pool of water around it.  Dogs were drinking and wading in it like a bunch of wild animals.  It looked like a scene out of National Geographic.  At other city dog parks, Ive seen actual spickets that you turn on that do not fester water pools.  I also think they could have provided a better shade area, with more coverage.\n\nAll I can say is that the dog had an amazing time regardless, and that was the point of all this.  Dog was tired for the rest of the day and now thinks Im the queen since I took his furry butt to the park!"

Five,"My new favorite restaurant. I have been here twice, now..the first time just randomly chose the chicken achari, and was completely amazed, the flavors exploded across my palate, with the subtle heat in the finish, was like nothing I've ever experienced. I upgraded to the potato naan, which is mashed potatoes stuffed between two delicious pieces of grilled bread..my second time, I got the curry sampler, combo thingy..three different curries, pickled onions, naan, and yogurt sauce..this is the way to go..always upgrade to the potato naan! The combo said it came with a desert on the menu, but not in reality..still the cold leftovers were a perfect finish.."
Five,"This is one of the nice Four Seasons resorts that we've been to. It is a bit of a large, sprawling complex set in the Arizona desert. It was a bit of a haul from Phoenix, but that is a small sacrifice for paradise. As you would expect from the FS, the service is top notch and they seem to anticipate your needs maybe before you do. Porters, valets, pool attendants seem to jump to serve you and I really like their touch of addressing you by name. There were a lot of common areas in the resort and they had ample seating. Rooms were spacious and had all the modern amenities that you would expect from a FS resort. The pool, spa and gym were all very nice. If you want a prime seat at the pool you had better get down there early and stake your claim. Cabanas fill up quick and by the time you are done with breakfast, you'll be lucky to find a seat. We took advantage of there off season rates, which were a great deal. Sure it was pretty hot, but it was less crowded and we really enjoyed ourselves. \n\nI have never been out to the desert and the scenery and landscape really impressed me. I was like a little kid running around to see all the lizard and critters that we saw around the desert. Cottontails were hopping all around, we also saw a bunch of lizards and hummingbirds. We had a great room at the edge of the property that overlooked the desert and mountains. I would just chill out on the patio drinking coffee and one morning we saw a bobcat with a bunny for breakfast walk right by our porch. It was so cool. I felt like I was in a scene from wild kingdom. I rushed to snap a quick picture and have added it to this review. Of course pay attention when walking around the grounds, but no need to freak out. \n\nThe resort had a lot of activities for guests. We did wine tastings at Talavera and star gazing, which was really cool. They have more things that I don't remember, but they have a lot of things for the kids and families will surely appreciate them. \n\nYou will want to self park to save yourself some money. Just take the short path or let them cart you over. Restaurants and golf were stellar as well. Another Four Seasons gem. Enjoy yourself."

Five,"My wonderful boyfriend (whose pulse is always on the best new restaurants in town) took me to FnB for my birthday a few months back, and it was a perfect choice! Not realizing that Pavle our waiter was actually the owner, we marveled at how knowledgeable and adept he was, suggesting dishes and explaining their preparations. He even offered a complimentary glass of wine (Arizona-made, as are all of their beers and wines). We were totally impressed. All of our dishes were flavorful and imaginative, from the leek/mozzarella appetizer to my fish entree to my BF's jadori chicken. It has been 4 months since our trip and I still remember the food and the experience vividly, which is saying something since I usually can't remember what I ate yesterday. I loved the open kitchen and the casual gastro-pub environment; it is clear that the food is the focus at FnB. It's a refreshing change from the scene you find at many Scottsdale restaurants. It's a little pricey for my grad student budget, but definitely fair for the quality. I hope to return very soon!"
Four,"""We enjoyed the food, the most disturbing part was when two men in plan cloths walked in with \OPEN AND CARRY\"""" guns.  While this might be legal in Arizona, I personally felt uneasy and very unsafe.  The manager asked us how everything was and I said the food was great but I do not care to see guns in a restaurant unless they are on the police officers and we quickly walked out.  I will not do business with a company that allows 'OPEN AND CARRY FIREARMS\"""" on a person while I am eating."""""""
Four,"""Jobing.com sits at the South end of Westgate, which is one of those places that makes you thank the lord for the night time because everything seems a little less out of place in this California Coastal type \mall\"""" stuck in the middle of the desert. There is an array of restaurants (chainy although they may be) to suit most tastes and if you find yourself needing to score some extra points because it was pointed out to you during dinner that you don't bring me flowers, you can grab some from one of the vendors out by the central fountains. Clientele is a mix of extremes; so regardless of whether you are stuck forever in blue jeans or dressed to the nines and looking to share some of that brother love, you will fit right in.\n\nFirst time visitors may find parking options and street navigation a little like driving Brooklyn roads without a map, but hell yeah the arena has a few people posted at the common entrances that are more than willing to try and answer questions.\n\nHolly Holy this is actually a decent place to see a concert! Shocking as I am generally disappointed with the arena type venue. From the first beautiful noise to the last note, it was an evening that was definitely done too soon. The acoustics are solid and even the crunchy granola suite sitting next to us seemed comfortable in our side stage seats. Leg room is ample enough, which seems rare in this age of pack them in arenas and cup holders are within easy reach... all things that improve any venue by at least one star.\n\nWe picked up our tickets at Will Call as I'm a believer this is the only way to go. No fuss, no muss!\n\nThe crowd was well controlled and polite as far as concerts go. Long lines were well managed and although the air was electric with anticipation, there was a pretty amazing grace about all of the staffers, patiently keeping everyone moving toward their final destination. When asked if I was in line for the bar, a simple 'I am I said' retained my place without having to throw an elbow or smash a toe. When I reached the front of the line, a solitary man was serving up everything from cherry cherry Icee's to mixed drinks, which btw, I love on the rocks. One note, if you are purchasing a beverage that comes in a bottle; you might want to have them transfer the contents to a cup because they refuse to let you take the caps in to the arena itself... something about safety issues. I have to admit I found this a little odd, I mean what if I wanted to play me a round of the shell game to pass the time before the show started?\n\nIf you plan on being home before dark, you might want to avoid valet parking. Although this is a welcome service, the wait to retrieve your vehicle may make you cry out 'sweet caroline' is this line ever going to move or look for a man of god to give you last rights?!!  I mean cracklin' rose, it's not like we're crossing a border and coming to America, just get my car already!! \n\nAll in all, the night was great and I wouldn't hesitate to return to Jobing.com to take in a show.\n\n... now can you guess the show ..."""""""
Three,"I only know Scorpion Bay as a visitor, not a member. It certainly looks nicer and newer than Pleasant Harbor, that's for sure.

They did have beer, and some food, but mostly chips and the like. I was hoping for a sandwich or hot dog -- something a little more substantial.\n\nIf you didn't want chips, the other option is Dillon's. Nice! I've had Dillon's BBQ before at their main location, and found it pretty good. \n\nBut I didn't want to sit down and have a big meal. I wanted to get back on the water. I was hoping they would have a walk-up bar or something where I could grab a pulled pork sandwich and some fries to go.

I originally wanted to be a chef so at the young age of 12 I got my first prep cook job in a small town at Zapatas Mexican Restaurant. It wasn't long until I was 13 and running the kitchen at night. I'm sure this was illegal, but who cared in Page/Lake Powell, AZ?\n\nLong story short - I ended up pursuing another career, the owner passed away and the new ownership screwed up the recipes and menu. Since then, I have been on an endless journey to find my 'Zapatas' here in the Valley. The closest I had found was El Minuto in Tucson. And then one day, my brilliant friend and co-worker invited me to lunch.\n\nThat's when...I met Valle Luna.\n\nIt's been a dirty love affair ever since. A time warp back to my youthful days at Zapatas. The chips are fried in-house. The shredded beef tacos are everything I remembered them to be. I finally have found a reincarnated Zapatas!!!!\n\nThis is true Sonoran Mexican food as it was meant to be."

Anything on the menu is delicious.  \n\nAbout the Mesa vs. Phoenix thing...to be honest, I think the Mesa one tastes better. The Mesa one definitely tastes more authentic and has more flavor. The Phoenix one tastes more Americanized as if it is geared toward Gringos.\n\nThat being said, the Service is horrible and it's been horrible for the last 10 years or so. No, I'm not being hard on them.  They charge for refills on chips!!!! They give you very little chips in a small tin bowl.  They don't refill your drinks. They take forever before you order.  They are inflexible in altering items to cater to vegetarians (Im not vegetarian but I've been there with vegetarians). The waiters have attitude and leave before you can ask questions. \n\nIf the service was somewhat respectable, I would eat there more often. Still the food is delicous but go there with the expectation that you will pay a lot of money and endure horrible service.  It's almost a joke because the service is so consistently bad the owner doesn't really care because people still eat there.

As it always is, the food was excellent and the portions were very generous.  I usually have the pho and it is always great.\n\nIn this particular area around Lee Lee's there are tons of pho places, this is my favorite.

Finally made it this week and I took along my little brother who is a keen aficionado of all that is new, hip, cool and whatever other term kids are saying now days.

Great for him, and extra \cool big sister\"""" points for me.  \n\nEntry to the place is from the back - which gives a pleasantly different impression than the front.  When we went it was a bit of a problem to get back there as the opening in the construction for \""""Business access\"""" had been blocked a bit more than it should have been.  Word to the wise - if you miss it, just park next door and walk on over.  While you are walking, relish the fact that not too terribly long from now there will be a light rail stop across the street. My brother was quite excited by the prospect.  \n\nEntering Stinkweeds I was immediately shocked by how small it was.  Really shocked.  But then ya look around and realize they have almost an entire wall of listening stations.  For a spot this small to invest in that is really a testament to how they value and know their customers.  In the hour or so while we were there we saw several groups of people go right to them listen to several selections and then walk up to the register with their purchases.  My brother and I meandered around the place. He went in alphabetical order, front to back.  I went right for the Paste station.  Stinkweeds in the only spot in Phoenix with a Paste station, and as I am a huge fan of Paste magazine, I was really excited.  (Review within a review: Paste is an awesome magazine about music, movies, pop culture, video games, books etc and in each edition they include a cd with new and cool music.  The Paste listening station allows you to hear more by the same artists that are covered in that month's cd.  And the cd's always rock.  Stinkweeds also sells the magazines, including those cds, in the back. They even had some old editions which really helped me when looking for some cds.)  \n\nI couldn't find an artist I was looking for, went to the counter to ask about it and I was told how easy it was to get.  She took down my name and number and said she'd give me a call Wednesday when it came in.  Presto.  She was very nice.\n\nI left with 2 cd's, and one on the way.  My brother left with 4 - but he wanted even more.  He was excited for some used Spoon he found.  Used Spoon.  Reminds me of an old Korn joke.  Anyhow, I highly suggest the place.  Visit regularly, visit often.\n\nUpdate:  She called when the CD came in and left a message.  I never returned her call because I got busy, or always forgot, or some other lame excuse.  Almost a week later I finally made it there.  The CD was still behind the counter with my name on it. Oh yea....."""""""

[did I mention that I once thought that mid-century clothing was butt-ugly?]\n\nIf hubby and I were just starting out again, we'd be Retro Redux's best customers and deck our home out in mid-century gloriousness instead of what we have now. Hey, maybe we'll chuck our creaky old antiques and head on down sometime!"
Five,"One of the best things about golfing in the Phoenix area is that there are many great high end courses where the general public is welcome. Here in the Boston area, most of the best courses are snooty private clubs.\n\nRaven is one of the best golf courses I have played in Phoenix.  It can be pricey, especially during the peak season in the spring, but the course is beautiful and challenging, and since the desert golf motif is my personal favorite, it ranks high up there for me.  For a little less $$, Legacy and Vistal are nearby, and are also nice courses with great views of South Mountain."
Four,"I am a sucker for James Beard Award places so this made my short-list this year for my trip.\n\nIt's in a cute heritage area just outside the mammoth convention centers and sport stadium, so parking is a bit of a pain.  Once you get inside, it's incredibly quaint.  There is a server/menu mismatch since I'm guessing there are not a lot of Asian people in the area.  So to hear the server (who looks like a student backpacker) describe an isakaya and items where there is some Chinese influence, it gave me a good laugh.\n\nThat being said, the food is excellent.  The portions are small so I'd recommend 3-4 dishes for 2 people.  We shared the curried lamb with mango (mmmm, so good!)  If there are any Vancouverites reading this, think Vij's lamb popsicles but marinaded in a different sauce.\n\nThe warm duck salad is excellent!  It's a neat twist to serve the salad warm and slightly seared and it paid off well.\n\nThe pork belly buns were delicious - I've never had these before!  They use the Chinese style steamed bun material but shape it into ovals that they fold in half and insert the pork belly filling.  Excellent!\n\nThe menu is small but very solid.  Service was OK and if this was more polished/authentic/better fitting to a higher-end Asian restaurant, I would bump this up to a 5."
Five,"""Moved on from the S.S.S. Plate to French Bistro style Gallettes.  Excellent appetizer of crisply toasted flat bread (thin & brittle) topped with small bits of bacon, sweet caramelized onions, chips of black olives and a sprinkling of parmesan cheese. Together with Dr. L's Riesling was delightful on the patio with some afternoon shade.\n\nFor the main course we shared the grilled vegetable platter with the special sauce (one for him and one for her).  A very generous portion of broccoli, carrots, pea pods, cauliflower, purple onions, beans and mushrooms.  Being an occasional vegetarian the grilled veggies are superior to steamed and other forms of preparation.\n\nFollowup with more water and the large tart key lime tart with real key lime juice and tart to boot... Did I say tart twice?  YES\n\nFor those who were aware of the erotic art on the inside near the window (John, is that what I think it is?, Yes, Martha, that is what you think it is.  John, ask the waiter if that is what I think it is.  Sir, is that what she thinks it is? Yes, that is what she thinks it is and some people have been offended but most take it in stride)... \n\nWell, you yelpers who read this far the \art\"""" is gone but there is an old NYC cab hanging from the ceiling plus the names of hundreds of NYC cab drivers on the wall behind the bar."""""""
Five,"I was fortunate to have a good friend take me to this little gem of a place last Sunday.  When we arrived around 12 the place was packed with a decently long wait.  This didn't realy bother me because it likely meant that the place was legit.  I never see a chinese restaurant with a wait.  Also large asian population of patrons which is also a good sign.  This was only the second time I had experienced dim sum.  It was an awesome experience and everything I had was soooo good, even though most of what I put into my mouth I had no idea what I was eating.  Didn't care.  This place is fantastic and I can't wait to come back and try more things or even their takeout menu.  Most authentic chinese food I've found in AZ thus far."
Four,"That's too bad this place has such low reviews.  My guess is the people are probably complaining about how busy it gets.  Well duh.. stick a gym in the middle of the Biltmore area, of course it'll get packed.  \n\nBest time to go is in the early morning or mid day.  DO NOT go at 5PM.. because you will be waiting a long time for any equipment. \n\nWhat I love about this place is the staff is friendly and they have their own NRGize Cafe that i love getting the shakes from. Yummm..\n\nI love this place so I wont complain.  Why not 5 stars then?  Well because I too have been here when it's busy and it sucks.. but I wont ruin the review over it.\n\n:)"
Three,"Not the best sushi  but it's prolly the most decent place to go to if you're looking for good sushi in Tempe. So I come in here with my boyfriend and a friend of mine. Sushi is good, but not the best. Prices are pretty decent. Average about $14 a specialty roll. Has a nice vibe to it. Looks like it gets pretty busy at night time. We came in for the specialty drinks, which were good. Great place to have drinks and sushi. Not a quiet place. The only downfall is that customer service is pretty sh*tty here. Servers don't really know what the hell they are doing here. Would prolly try this place again. Don't expect servers to refill your drinks, you're gonna have to wave them down."
One,"Very bad Chinese....\n\nMe and my wife took a chance and went here last night. I read the mixed reviews, and thought that the good should out-weigh the bad, not in this case the food was horrible. We ordered for starters..egg drop soup...soup was bland and lacking flavor.\nNext I order Happy Family, my wife orders Mongolian Beef, we were excited to try this place as it is close to our house. \nWell, we were very disappointed, the Mongolian Beef tasted like imitation meat, with a spice sauce that just wasn't right. Then we get the Happy Family and it tastes like imitation meat also, it was very hard not just to leave the restaurant, the only thing that was halfway cooked right was the white rice. \nWith that said, the portions they give are small, and they charge too much for the product --even though the product is horrible.. I thought yesterday while I was eating, I wouldn't even feed this to my dog..that's how bad it was...When we went to pay our bill the server noticed that we left quite a bit of food on the table, they asked if we would like to take it home, we declined...what a waste of time and money!!!\n\nThe food here is borderline gross and we will not be back!"
Five,"Tracy is the MAN. you should go see him if anything ever happens to your car. \n\nHe might possibly be the nicest, most professional, honest man. \n\nI can't tell you how many times i have done something stupid to my car. And about 90% of the time I end up at Tracy's. \n\nI am a bargain shopper and Tracy always gives me the best quotes.

Four,"""Eggsalent Breakfast! (yah, I know sounds dorky, but it really was excellent).  Coffee is presented to you like you are the only person in world having a cup of coffee, something nice about that.  \n\nNOTE:::  Since the last time I was in there, about a month or so ago-- it is now closed down and either has or is going to re-open as \Toast\"""" but located next door?

One,"One of the rare times I indulge in restaurant food is for breakfast, and I wanted to try Taco Bell's new breakfast menu. I pulled into the drive-thru at 7:20 a.m., and all the inside and outside lights were on, including the drive-thru menu's, but the only person working was the guy power-washing the sidewalks--nobody home even though there were signs everywhere advertising that the place was now open for breakfast! I headed to my office dejectedly and checked the website to find out this location doesn't open until 9 a.m. If you're going to serve a breakfast menu, please keep breakfast hours that suit the average commuting breakfast eater, especially when you're competing with a dozen other fast food joints in a half-mile radius who are all also serving breakfast but open at 6 if they're not already open 24 hours. I have had other stuff from here since I've worked and lived nearby for the past 10 years, and it's otherwise decent service and passable fast food, but with so many other affordable and decent Mexican joints around with drive-thru windows, this isn't worth it for lunch or dinner, either, unless you're in a real time crunch."
Four,"Here for a work trip. Wish I could stay longer & take advantage of all the amenities (spa, shows, hiking, etc)\n\nThe facilities are very sleek & modern. Comfy beds, tastefully appointed rooms. Great gym & pool. Staff are insanely nice & helpful.\n\nGrabbed a quick lunch in the food court (decent selection for omnis-- but vegans can only get a Boca Burger at Fatburger  or adapt the Veggie Wrap at Boar's Head), so I can't comment on the restaurants or bars.\n\nLike most casino hotels, the smell of smoke permeates... Blech. The casino is small (though I've never been anywhere but Vegas, so maybe this is normal?) & full of old fogies (uh, it is a Monday afternoon...)"
Four,"On a cold winter day, the craving for hot comfort in a bowl makes a person do strange things. It found me driving to a kind of shady part of Mesa, while braving the cold winds in search of a perfect bowl of ph\u00f2.\n\nMy new holy grail of Vietnamese restaurants is Ph\u00fa Th\u00e0nh, located in a rundown strip mall on Southern and Extension. A good Vietnamese restaurant is usually kind of old, slightly dingy and super cheap, and in this case all the basics were met and exceeded.\n\nPh\u00fa Th\u00e0nh is a no-frills kind of place. Inside it screams for a makeover. Though clearly from another era, it is clean and functional. The service is friendly and the kitchen is fast.\n\nThere might be a slight familiarity here the owners of Ph\u00fa Th\u00e0nh and my favorite central Vietnamese joint Da V\u00e0ng are brothers. The menus of the two places are almost identical, and they offer a lot.\n\nThe No. 50 Ch\u00e0 Gi\u00f2 ($2) is what good Vietnamese cooking is all about. Two golden-brown, crunchy egg rolls filled with shrimp and pork are hands on and interactive. Served with a plate of lettuce leaves and herbs, you wrap the egg roll in lettuce and garnish with mint and cilantro, then dunk them into the house-made n?\u00f2c ch\u00e2m, a sweet and spicy dipping sauce. The fresh lettuce and herbs cut through the richness of the egg roll, which on its own might be slightly oily.\n\nApplying the same hands-on approach, the No. 54 B\u00e1nh X\u00e8o ($3.95) replaces the rolls with a pan-fried rice flour crepe. The exterior is slightly crispy, while the soft interior is filled with shrimp and bean sprouts. Of all the B\u00e1nh X\u00e8o I've tried, this version is by far my favorite. It's full of flavor and texture.\n\nPh\u00f3 (pronounced like the bad word) is not only fun to say, but fun to eat. Eight versions of the noodle soup are offered, from traditional beef to chicken. Pay attention to the menu description when ordering since you might wind up with unfamiliar cuts of meat.\n\nI'm adventurous and love the textures of beef tendon and tripe, so I was in heaven when my steaming bowl of No. 1 Ph\u00f2 Ph\u00fa Th\u00e0nh ($4.95) arrived. The broth was incredibly fragrant with clove and star anise. This really should be made into an air freshener.\n\nAlong with the condiments at the table, the soup comes with a plateful of basil and bean sprouts. But also include limes and chilis to add texture, flavor and depth to your pho experience.\n\nFor something hearty and comforting, the No. 7 M\u00ec B\u00f2 Kho ($4.75) is a bowl of chewy egg noodles filled with a beef stew. Tender pieces of stewed carrots and beef grace the rich and complex flavors of the dark and tasty brew.\n\nIf you're carbohydrate loading, order a slab of French bread to absorb all of the bone-warming elixir at the bottom of the bowl.\n\nFor food like this, a little shady is worth the drive."
Two,"I have been here a handful of times.  I was in the market for an Electra cruiser bike for myself.  The salesman that greeted me was nice and very helpful (only reason I gave this store 2 star).  He spent a good 30 minutes with me explaining to me the different cruiser bikes they had for sale and pros and cons of each.  I decided I wanted an Electra cruiser.  He didn't have the one I wanted in stock. He said he would call Electra on Monday and order it for me.  He took my number and said he would call me when they got it in (that was back in April).  I have yet to get a phone call.  I had also placed a special order that day for a wicker basket for my daughter's Electra cruiser.  They called me that same Friday to tell me they had gotten it in.  I went in to purchase it and pick it up on Saturday only to find they hadn't gotten the basket in yet. I figured it was an honest mistake and let it go: so, I placed an order for bike pads (didn't have ANY in stock) for my son's BMX bike.  They told me the bike pads would be in the following Monday with a shipment they would be receiving, to just come on in.  I went back that Monday and they weren't there.  Needless to say, I have yet to ever go back.  \n\nAs for my desire to purchase myself a cruiser; I ended up going to Sport Chalet at Tempe Marketplace and purchased an Electra Townie 3i.  It's unfortunate because Rage is just a 5 minute bike ride away from me.  It's a nice local bike shop that I would have loved to shop at and support with my business.  My kids are young and will need at least two more bikes each before they get to buy their own bikes using their own money.  :-P"
Two,"My boyfriend and I have been here a couple of times and we loved it.  I continually ordered the shrimp po'boy and it was great.  There mac and cheese is definiately good!!  We enjoyed this place so much that we decided to bring some friends for dinner because they had never been to this resturant.  Our dinner was expensive and was not worth the money.  I do not mind spending money if the meal is worth it.  I ordered a rare filet with lobster.  The filet was extremely rare, it was as if they left it on the grill just to brown the outsides.  The inside was cold it was so rare.  The lobster was chewy and difficult to eat.  It was later at night so idk if they stopped putting effort in cooking and wanted to get out of work or what.  Our wait staff was very friendly though.  On a good note, there sourdough bread is very good."
Five,"""This awesome park and recreation center makes me wish we lived in Peoria. We were here today for a FRAG (reef tank geeks) picnic and the whole area is new and beautiful with lots of different amenities. We saw sand volleyball courts, a spashground (with critters spouting water) for the little kids, a skate park packed with older kids, picnic ramadas, fishing areas, baseball fields, batting cages, and a duck pond. There is even a Starbuck's.\n\nWe were at the group ramada BBQ pavilion, the likes of which I have never seen before. It was a huge covered circle of about a dozen BBQ grills with ventilation hoods hanging above and a cement \bar\"""" from which to serve on the outside circle and smaller cement \""""tables\"""" behind on which to do prep work. There were also sinks in the center to wash up. Surrounding this circle of grills were corresponding ramadas with picnic tables numbered for your group.

Four,"I love Stinkweeds, it might be small, but it is packed with tons of great music.  The staff is friendly and knowledgeable, they let you do your own thing, but they are completely approachable if you have any questions.  I have enjoyed seeing some of the in-store performances they have.  I also love the fact that they have promotional material for new releases, and I have gotten quite a few posters there.  I almost always buy my concert tickets there as well, I will gladly support Stinkweeds when I can.\n\nThe only complaint I have is when it gets busy in there, it is incredibly difficult to move around and it can get pretty hot in there.  I do have to admit I miss the other locations."
One,"Corbin's has been a disaster from the beginning, literally.  I anxiously waited for their opening day, even with such enthusiasm that I dropped by to get a menu prior to my first dining visit.  I made a visit shortly thereafter only to find that their official hours weren't the same as indicated on the menu.  Big mistake.\n\nOn later visits, when I was able to eat here, the food was interesting in that it was non-traditional on many accounts, and had good presentation, but was very lacking in taste.  Service was poor, staff was snooty, and I could have sworn that those were 10 ounce mugs used for draft beer at happy hour.  Even if they were 12's, come on, the norm is 16 oz. pint or larger these days."
Four,"If you come here expecting it to be like authentic Italian food made by a mama and grandmama from Italy, then you may be disappointed.  Haha I know sounds wierd, I am basically saying don't expect too high, and you will be fine. But as a family eatery with prices to not hurt the wallet while you drag kids and grandparents out, OSF really is decent.  I have neither kids nor grandparents, but I managed to see it and enjoy it, for what it is.\n\nMaybe its because I always get the same thing, the manager's favorite, with Mizithra cheese and clam sauce.  Then I mix it all together and I am a happy happy person.  I cannot get this anywhere else.  Now I am not saying you go and try this, I only know a handful of people that like it the way I do, but I will repeat, OSF is the only place I can get it at.  So from 3 stars I give it 4.\n\nNow the bread usually is good, but this location can get inconsistent.  The salad is just busy work till you get your food.  Nothing to talk about there. I have tasted food from others' plate, like lasagna and parmigiana chicken.  They were alright.  Sometimes tasty, other times just blah. The little dish of ice cream you get at the end is perfect. \n\nI really can understand the lower ratings on this place, its not really consistent.  But I do like it and enjoy my dish.  I have gotten lucky with service, no complaints there.  Overall a 3.5 place, rounded up to 4."
Five,"Great Italian food and served in a super cute atmosphere.  The service was good and our waiter was very attentive to our table. The food was great...we started with the Gnocchi which was wonderful! I had the Chicken Marsala and also tried some of the Lasagna...both were fantastic.  The best part of the night was the wonderful Chianti that was suggested to us and the shot of Sambuca that was brought to us after our dinner, compliments of the house.  i would give this place a try if you are looking for a great Italian dinner...everyone that has been from my recommendation, LOVED it. :)"
Four,"A colleague of mine who used to work in Phoenix recommended a visit to the Heard Museum and, wanting to indulge in a little bit of culture that wasn't an art museum per se, I knew I had to stop by.\n\nI've never been to a museum solely dedicated to Native American history; I've only seen small collections in art museums.  The Heard's collection is amazing:  everything from a thousand year old pottery to Navajo rugs to an exhibit introducing the visitor to each of Arizona's many tribes.  Many are interactive and include activities for kids.  I can see this being a great place to take children to.\n\nBeautiful building and wonderful collection.  I hope the Heard continues to do well and educate the public on Native American history.\n\nQuick side note:  Excellent little cafe, stop in for a bit to eat after exploring the museum.  Don't forget to pop your head into the gift shops, either.  Beautiful pieces, but really expensive!"
Four,"I went to visit a friend up in N Scottsdale and we decided to try this place with our families. I had no expectations going in. I was just hungry.\n\nWe were seated almost immediately. There were 7 of us, so prepping a table was in order. Immediately we were introduced to our waiter and drink orders taken. \n\nThey served the complimentary chips and salsa. I could have satisfied my hunger with that. The chips (and those who know me well, know I am not a chip person, nor a salt person.) were not salty, not oily, and the salsa was so delicious!! It had a great roasted flavor and just enough heat to satisfy me, but not spoil my taste for my dinner. Yum....\n\nI ordered the seafood enchiladas. My friend ordered the chorizo stuffed chicken. Once my friend to her first bite, she was hooked. I actually heard a groan of satisfaction escape her. That says a lot considering she ran her own restaurant and is pickier than I am with my food. My seafood enchiladas were delicious! The seafood wasn't rubbery and overcooked. The salmon inside was tender and perfectly cooked. They didn't tell me what the catch of the day was though. I didn't care. It was GOOD. The side dishes were good too. I was happy to hear that the pinto beans were cooked with a chicken stock and not pork products. Whew!\n\nSince this was my first trip, I am hoping that they are consistent. I want to go back. As I'm typing this up, my stomach is screaming at me to fill it.*"
Two,"""This place was mediocre. The people were nice enough, but I'm not going back here.\n\nTip: BRING YOUR OWN NAIL POLISH! Their selection is WEAK.

It is an eclectic piece that looks striking in our modern, minimalistic family room. We will be back soon to take another look at all the furniture on the top floor as well.

Four,I have been driving past this place everyday for the past year and never really gave it any thought.  Friday on my way home I was in the mood for Asian Cuisine so I stopped in and ordered some take out.  I ordered General Tso's Chicken.  When I got home I was pleased.  The Chicken was moist and had a very good flavor.  The only thing I was disappointed in was the rice.  It was a little dryer than I expected but still good.\n\nI think I waited about 15 min to get my food since I didn't call ahead.  It seems to be a popular place; there were people coming to get their orders they called in and others walking in to have dinner.  The staff new the regular customers which made me feel that they appreciate their customers.\n\nFor the the amount of food and the quality I'm not going to be going to Panda anymore.
Four,"Ok, my review is for their lunch only because I used to go there quite a bit for their lunch specials. Its ideal if you want to get good food for a good price on your lunch break. Their Mr. Pinks pasta and salad combo is just the right amount for lunch. The wedge salad is great if you are looking for something on the lighter side. Sitting inside or outside is great and you will probably hear a little Frank Sinatra before heading back to work. The staff is very nice, friendly, and quick!"
One,"""OK. The old location at 7350 Bell is gone. Empty. Now they are right in back of a Chevron station in the old Quiznos store at 51st Ave. & Bell Rd.\nIt still looks a lot like it did when Quiznos was there. Plain Jane inside and nothing much. The person making the food goes into a long explanation about how they make the pizzas and it's all on a chalkboard on the wall.\nYou kinda feel like you are ordering a pizza in a Circle K. Now you've got it. The toppings go on a cracker thin crust and they put it on a conveyor belt to \cook\"""" it. Looks like the same machine the Quiznos subs went through to \""""toast\"""" them. 4 1/2 minutes later, it's ready. Oh boy. I stared at it on our table in disbelief that I paid fifteen bucks for it, but reluctantly ate it.\nI have to be honest here and tell you that this was probably the weakest excuse for a pizza I have had in my entire life. You'd be better off going to the supermarket, getting a Boboli crust and some tomato sauce, etc. and making one at home. Toppings were a joke, tomato sauce was tasteless, and the atmosphere was kind of like eating in a truck stop off the freeway going to Los Angeles. Run away. Fast. If you love this place, I'm happy for you, but you couldn't drag me screaming back here."""""""

I'm so so glad we went there, and I was double happy this afternoon when I ate my leftovers for lunch. The best thing about the pad thai at Wild Thaiger (besides that it is so good) is that there is so much I always have lunch the next day ( which is just lovely). \n\nA note for those south of McDowell trying to get to Wild Thaiger: Drive up 3rd Street and turn left on Roanoke.

The ambiance is great and the food is old style Mexican.  Upon my first visit to AZ over 20 years ago, we visited this place and have always gone back.  You won't be disappointed.  Great for kids too."
Four,"8 things i love about you bandera:\n\n1. your welcoming atmosphere - thank you for opening your kitchen doors to us - literally! walking through it made me feel like you had nothing to hide and everything to share!\n\n2. your super friendly service - clean-cut uniforms with little sheriff like badges with your names on them, super smiley and attentive service, and just enough attention to keep our conversation flowing and our food & drink coming.\n\n3. your easy parking - lots of street parking and a quiet lot with special places to put my car. \n\n4. the way you fit right in - with matching yet modern decor to the old town scottsdale outside, you set the mood. i feel like biting straight into your famous flying chicken and ordering me an old-fashioned gimlet! \n\n5. your love letter of a menu - with wooing words of homey sides and starters, and a well varied assortment of meat, fish, vegetables, and desserts, i was spoiled even before beginning my meal. \n\n6. your cornbread - could i ask for anything warmer, sweeter, or comfier? with bites of jalapeno and delicious crunchy parts, you had me at corn--.\n\n7. your banana cream pie - with real chunks of fruit (yes!), and a wonderful praline-like crust, you were lighter and healthier than i expected. all the more reason for me to want you more.\n\n8. the way you make me wanting more - i need to see you again. i long to see you again. for those beef ribs. for that prime rib. for that barbequed salmon. and to revisit that grilled halibut and mexican cucumber salad. mMmmM."
Two,"The service here is HORRIBLE.  I know the menu better than most of the employees, they rarely come by the table to check on you, often times I feel ignored, and their food is moderately so-so.\n\nAll of the issues I have with this location stem from management.  they are not being accountable and overseeing their operation.  My guess is that they use their position to supplement their dating life.  I have no evidence to support that, but I've seen it a time or two before and this is exactly what it looks like."
Four,"Came here last night with the wife and friends.  Love the atmosphere.  They don't take reservations and a Friday night, so they quoted us an hour wait time.  It was definitely less than that and the great company made the time fly by in the outside bar area. The waiter was very nice.  He made a few mistakes with our orders, but nothing that ruined our meal.  I started with the pork chili....tender with a nice kick.  Next was the steak- great flavor.  I was supposed to have extra potatoes but they sent me extra brocolli...no complaints about that mistake as the meal overall was quite heavy.  All in all a nice evening and tasty meal."
Two,"""where is the love? something was missing with my last visit to Joe's New York Pizza.......where is Joe?!?! i admit it has been at least a year since i have been in there last.( i got hooked on the other side of the street with best of Italy pizza) i couldn't get enough people to agree on one type of pie so i got a few slices.  They were big slices and the crust was thin, they might have had a chance if they were not \marinating\"""" in the window for an hour.  i like to load up on parm and crushed red pepper after I'm through with condiments it all tastes the same but nothing i can do can hide far from fresh product.  if you find yourself on that side of town and need late night food check out Best of italy or Philly Sandwich(24hrs!!!wtf) on 5th ave and scottsdale"""""""
Four,"Today was our first time eating here, so armed with great reviews from other Yelpers, we sampled a bevy of appetizers from the happy hour menu (daily from 4:30-7p) and shared a pasta entree. Of the apps, we had toasted ravioli, a platter of antipasti, and by recommendation from our lovely server, Amber, the stuffed eggplant.  The toasted ravioli was delicious-crispy and battered with a crust of parmigiana, melty cheese on the inside. A dip in the flavorful and slightly spicy marinara sauce finished it off.  \n\nThe antipasti platter serves about 2 light eaters, but for me and my spouse, it was a nice compliment to the two other shared appetizers. \n\nThe stuffed eggplant was covered inside and out with gooey, cheesy goodness and marinara sauce.  This was to be the main portion of my meal while my husband had gorged on the appetizers, but after a taste, he started sneaking bites while I wasn't looking!  I added some chili flakes for a little heat, but It was very flavorful.  I'm not a huge melted cheese lover and would've preferred a little less cheese, but it was perfect for my husband.\n\nThe restaurant wasn't super busy when we arrived at 6pm, but by the time we left around 8pm, the main dining room and the adjoining small rooms were about 85% filled.  The prices were higher than what we normally spend, but we had been given gift cards by my brother and happened to come during happy hour, so it wasn't that bad at all. Our bill came out to about $17 without tip and we didn't order drinks.  \n\nYou do have to sit in the bar area to receive the happy hour specials, but we didn't mind.  We'll be back!"
Two,Ok so wanted to try this place out since I heard they were really good so I did and man I should have gotten the whole scoop on how long there wings take. After 45 minutes I asked what was wrong with our order especially cause there was only three other customers in there the employee went ahead and told me they threw my wings away cause the other ones were too small. I was like really I would have taken it by the end of the hour we finally got our wings and compensated by giving me one wing extra. Needless to say we ended up going to another restaurant and getting served fast. Call ahead an hour and you'll be ok there wings are good but an hour for ten wings maybe not...
Two,"Ok, so never tried this place, even though it is less than 5 minutes from my house. We (me plus 2) get there and they are super busy. Thought it was weird since it was Monday night at 8pm...but there is a wait. They have exactly- one server, one busser, and one bartender serving food to help out. We only waited about 15 minutes..not bad. We sit down, wait about 15 minutes to see a server...we decide what we want to eat by the time he actually gets there. He takes our drink order and as my friend starts to give her food order, he walks away. He comes back takes our order...we never see that guy again until the bill. When our food came, our entrees were supposed to have tortillas...but no tortillas. I got the Carne Adovada plate which was SUPER salty and had no flavor at all. It was as if they mixed masa with it to thicken it but didn't blend it well. My friend got the Chicken Mole Enchiladas which were pretty good, nothing great and my other friend got seafood enchiladas which had hardly any filling to the enchiladas. I asked 3 times for the tortillas...that never came. Our waiter came after we were done with our food and asked if we wanted more drinks. We were done at that point."
Four,"I'm not generally a big buffet person, but I can handle them from time to time for breakfast or brunch (not so much for lunch or dinner), so when I was in town for Thanksgiving I stopped in here with my dad, brother-in-law, & nephew the Friday after turkey day, and I gotta say this is a pretty solid spot.\n\nMy (older & retired) parents have begun coming here for breakfast once every two weeks or so because they love a good deal, and at $9.95 (Mon thru Fri...it's more on weekends) it's hard to beat this place. \n\nSome highlights include the omelet station (where they will also make you sunny side up eggs or fresh scrambled eggs if you're like me and are kind of picky about eating eggs that aren't fresh), the area where they do a lot of Mexican style breakfast food including mini breakfast burritos with chorizo, and the pastry/baked good area. I was actually VERY impressed with the baked goods, which I got the impression were baked fresh right there in the kitchen (if they weren't, they fooled me). I had a chocolate chip scone as well a sticky bun, and they both rivaled pastries you would get at a fancy shmancy bakery. \n\nOf course Wandering Horse also has all the other typical breakfasty items you would expect to find at a buffet (sausage, bacon, hash browns, hot/cold cereal, fruit, etc...) and it's all good. \n\nWhat's also nice is that the price tag includes drinks like OJ, coffee & milk. I also noticed there is a bar in the dining room area where I'm guessing you can grab mimosas and Bloody Mary's.\n\nOne minor complaint I do have is that the service is kind of slow (and quite frankly...not friendly). It wasn't all that crowded when we were there and they were a little slow with drinks. \n\nOverall, Wandering Horse is a solid breakfast buffet and I'd come back!"
Five,"Super yummy! Great location! Very filling!\n\nWent here to grab a sammie before a meeting at City Hall. I got the Italian with provolone on wheat bread. Well, I ordered it on wheat but got French bread. BUT they gave me a cookie to say sorry for the mix-up... HOW NICE IS THAT!? I didn't care what bread I got, my waistline may care but who listens to their waistline these days, I just wanted to sandwich. And it was great!\n\nA tad spicey for me but I also choose the Italian seasoning too so I was asking for it. The cookies were so moist and soft, fell apart in my hand like delicious sand-heaven. The interior of this joint is so city-scape and metro. Super high ceiling, old bar like ordering station, booths that face out onto the street... everything was great!\n\nHad a bit of trouble understanding the guy making my lunch but if he was kind enough to give me a cookie for messing up my bread, he can talk as fast as he wants because I'll be back for sure. I went around 1:30pm and it was bumping so I'm assuming it's packed at peak lunch hour time, well worth the wait though."
Two,"""I'm def not a vegetarian but I decided to give Green a-go when my co worker (veggie head) wanted to grab some lunch. She had been here once before with less than desirable food, but figured she'd give it one more shot.\n\nWell, no more shots for Green are in our future...\n\nWe ordered at the desk and our food came out within 15 minutes. No big deal there. My friend ordered the artichoke dip that was served with chips and hummus that was served  with deep fried pita chips, and I ordered the Kung Pao \Chicken\"""". \n\nIf you didn't tell me there was artichokes in the dip, I would have never known. It was more of an enchilada sauce/bean dip weird mess. Not horrible on the pallet, but def not what we expected was ordered. The Hummus was spicy and came with a pickle (??) on the side. Pita crisps were way too deep fried for their own good. Needless to say... we did not ask for a to-go box. \n\nThe Kung Pao chicken wasn't bad per-say, but my \""""Chicken\"""" was very stringy and foamy to the texture. Yes, I said I wasn't a veggie head, but I have had Morning Star \""""chicken\"""" before and it's 10 times better than what  came in my bowl.\n\nI get veggie heads love this spot because they don't have to narrow down the menu to 2 items, but me thinks not."""""""
Five,"This is one of our favorite places for healthy, flavorful food.  We love spicy food and the Vindaloo dipping sauce is a staple for us here as we add it to just about everything we order.  For appetizers, the lentil cake towers, seared tofu, and baked samosas are some of our favorites, although we've honestly never had anything here that we haven't liked.  The vegetable naan-wrap and veggie flatbread both have great flavor and as far as the entrees go, we've had numerous combinations of veggies, tofu, chickpeas, lentils, etc. with both the Vindaloo and hot curry sauces and all have been delicious.  Bombay Spice also has a good selection of inexpensive wines available for $20-$40 per bottle that complement the food well.  If this place was located a bit closer to our house, we'd be there even more often given how many vegetarian options they have to offer."
Two,"my boyfriend has wanted to take me to this restaurant for 3 years. we finally went on a special occasion. i was looking forward to a really good meal and nice ambiance. ok, so the food was way overpriced for what you got. we went for breakfast. the portion was average, nothing spectacular and it was pricey for what you got. the service was super slow. yes, it was busy, however, it was slower then slow. it was very noisy, putting a damper on our special occasion. the decor was the only nice thing about the visity. service blew. prices blew. nothing special. i could've went to a hole in the wall diner and got a heaping portion for less money and better service."
Four,"The Roosevelt is a fantastic bar if you're looking for a low key evening with friends.  Located in a neighborhood that seems simultaneously sleepy and buzzing with energy, this bar is a perfect reflection of the direction that the downtown area is moving in, flaws and all.  \nBuilt in an old historic home in the Roosevelt district, the aptly named bar oozes charm in more ways than one can count.  There are 4 or 5 separate rooms inside that create a cozy atmosphere and a great sense of privacy.  Decorated with fancy wall papers, flowers on each table and a nice collection of candles, the Roosevelt would serve as an excellent place for a casual first date, but works just as well for a fun night of beer sampling and cheese-eating snobbery.\nWhile the bar offers a nice selection of wine, the Beer menu is the real star at the Roosevelt, so if your idea of a nice drink doesn't involve hops and yeast you may want to go somewhere else to imbibe.  With an impressive selection of top-shelf craft brews and imports, the Roosevelt is well worth checking out.  In fact, its the only place I have been to in my entire life that serves the Konig Ludwig Weiss, which I highly recommend trying if you make the trip out to the Roos'.\nIn spite of its many charms, the Roosevelt isn't without its flaws.  Service and seating can be hit and miss depending on when you decide to go.  Also, the lack of outdoor seating means that smokers will have to leave their drinks inside and walk out front if they want to light up.  I've been told that the ownership is working on this issue, but for the time being, if you want to smoke, you're doing it on the street.  Finally, the bar keeps odd ours which might freak out some folks in the drinking set.  I've heard rumors that they're closed on Mondays and know for a fact that on week nights they don't stay open much past midnight.  If this is an issue for you I would suggest calling ahead before planning a visit.  \nAll in all, the Roosevelt is a great place to go enjoy a few beers, relax and enjoy some conversation.  However, if you're looking for a booze fueled barn burner, you should probably look elsewhere because the Roosevelt is way too classy for that."
Three,"Short and sweet. Great food but a bit high priced. The service wasn't bad, we went at the ultimate lunch hour with a full house so you're bound to fall into hold ups. The only unattractive thing about the locale really are the prices, I mean I understand the location is in Scottsdale, but c'mon now. It made me really appreciate my hole in the wall dive mexican food joints.\nI will say that I'm huge critic about hispanic restaurants salsa, and their hot is pretty damn good w/ fresh chips always."
Three,"It was Saturday night and my husband and I wanted to try something new. We had been told to try FEZ, specifically the FEZ burger. So we decided to take the light rail from Tempe and go to FEZ.\n\nNow, just as others have posted, FEZ was good, but definetly not amazing. We get there and we were seated promptly, which is always a plus. The staff was ver friendly and helpful.\n\nWe got there right at the tail end of happy hour, so we decided to try the 2 4 1 margaritas. I got the pomengranite and my husband got the honey dew. They were ehhh. I still stand that margaritas should not be flavored, and these just did not change my mind.\n\nAs it was still happy hour, we decided to try an appitizer. We opted for the lettuce wraps. I really enjoyed these. The dried fruit and pomengranite vinagrette was a great combination. \n\nFor dinner, we both ordered the FEZ burger (no bun, of course).  Well I have to say we are both picky about our burgers. Now, the burgers were not bad, but not for us. It had a lot going on. Between the cheese, pears, bbq sauce, crispy onions, and more.. it was just too much. I enjoy a good burger with minimal toppings (i.e. LGO's green chili burger!). \n\nOn the side, I got the season vegetables, and they were excellent. My husband opted for the cinnamon sweet potato fries. Again, very good, but you can't beat the simple, yet excellent sweet potato fries at Delux. \n\nAlso, I should mention that we did try another FEZ drink, their fruit infused wine. It was just as the waiter described, sangria without the fruit. They really should call it sangria and add fruit. Would not recommend it. I think the next time I go I would go with Cherry Wheat on draft!\n\nWe are not going to rush back, but not opposed of giving FEZ another chance."
Four,"I have been here 2 times in the past week. It is that yummy! The first time i had the pak lok beef - it was very good, the beef was a bit tough but the flavors were amazing. My dinner companion was hoping there would be some adult beverages, but they do not sell alcohol yet. However it is BYOB with a corking fee. The second time i went with my Mom since she is a huge fan of different cuisines from around the world. We shared a cambodian coffee (yuuum and strong!) the crepes and ginger chicken stir fry. The crepes were both our favorite dish, i would still recommend the stir fried chicken though too! Both were delicious. Just a heads up though the chicken used was mostly dark meat, i love this cut of chicken but my mom prefers breast meat (she still thought it was yummy though). All of the meals i had there tasted so clean and fresh, a steal for the prices they have. Both times the servers were super friendly and nice. The time between the two shared dishes was perfect. The ambiance is very pleasant. I'll definitely be becoming a regular at this place."
Four,"Marshalls is my go-to for dresses and shoes, and this location does not disappoint. I strolled through last night and was impressed with the shoe department. Usually you'll see the tall shoe racks with random pairs of shoes arranged in order of sizing, but this location has a Shoe Mega Store, which apparently means the shoes are set up DSW style and come in boxes. Shocking! \n\nNow I don't have the patience to scour rack after rack for jeans or tops, but it is really easy to go dress and suit shopping here because there are many fewer racks and its pretty easy to see what's what without even touching the hangers. The dress selection here was slim, I will admit, but I found a calvin klein skirt suit that is ADORABLE and happens to look fantastic on me. Can anyone say clearance rack $49? Needless to say I walked out of Marshall's $50 lighter, but also much more stylish. \n\nPS: their home goods and lamps are really well priced too, and they have loads of cute pillows. oh Marshall's, I love you."
Four,"""Picazzo's pizza is excellente! \n\nMy wife and I were told about this little pizza place by a friend who swore by it, so we decided to try it out. We are sooooo glad that we did because the food quality & taste was amazing. My wife loves it so much that when I asked her where she wanted to go for her birthday...Dr. Weil's restaurant in Scottsdale or Picazzo's....guess which one she chose? Picazzo's FTW!\n\nThe prices are a little on the high side, but I am a firm believer in the saying, \you get what you pay for\"""" & this pizza place was worth every penny."""""""
Three,"""Cowboy Ciao states, \Our aim is simple and true: thrill each and every guest, at every visit, with an entertaining and memorable dining experience.\"""" I wish Cowboy Ciao had lived up to its promise. The Roaring Fork is better for \""""urban cowboy\"""" food, which is a surprise given the rave reviews that Cowboy Ciao has received.  \n\nThe restaurant has dubbed the decor \""""Border Baroque,\"""" and they note \""""one reviewer called it Addams Family meets Old West bordello.\"""" To me, it's more like a Disney version of Spanish Colonial/Santa Fe with a \""""Touched by an Angel\"""" vibe. One of the weirder elements is a raised table for four surrounded by faux adobe walls.  Prominently displayed above the table is a vintage-style black and white photo of a nearly nude male that has some strong gay bar overtones. The photo is cool, but it has a Rudolph Valentino feel and the only part about it that is even remotely southwestern is the wooden frame. It's an odd choice, but that is true for the entire Cowboy Ciao atmosphere.     \n\nThe layout of the dinner menu is also odd. It starts off by listing the desserts at the very top. The titles leave lots to the imagination as there is no detail provided and it's unclear why the menu lists the final element of the meal first. The intent may have been to tease the diner with a tempting array of sweet (and savory) endings, but it really looks more like it was laid out by an inexperienced member of a high school newspaper staff. \n\nThe Stetson Chopped salad ($12) was recommended by our server. It's odd that the menu provides no description for this salad, but that may be because the restaurant thinks this dish's reputation precedes it. The presentation of the salad is nice as it is arranged in rows of the individual ingredients running across the bowl (however, this presentation of salad is hardly original). The salad shows off good knife skills in the kitchen as the ingredients are uniformly chopped. The server walked us through the elements and then tossed the salad with the buttermilk pesto dressing. The BF really liked this dish and I thought the flavors were good and that the dressing was an interesting blend of ingredients. However, I really disliked the texture. It was chewy and gummy; almost like chewing salmon salad flavored gum. It's also over-priced. The entire salad would have measured less than a cup, so it made for a meager split appetizer. It's not like the ingredients for the salad are expensive. It's made up of cooked Israeli (pearl) couscous, Roma tomatoes, air-dried sweet corn, arugula, smoked salmon, and asiago cheese with toasted pepitas and dried black currants. \n\nGiven the stingy portion on the Stetson Chopped, we decided to try the Mini Mushroom Pan Fry ($14). It's a scaled down version of the restaurant's signature entree. It features cremini, button, oyster, cepe, lobster, black, trumpet, shiitake, morel and yellow foot mushrooms in ancho cream. The sauce was a deep brown color, but it was in desperate need of salt. Even with salt, it was amazing how flat the blend of mushrooms tasted. The dish is served over \""""double-cooked\"""" polenta. I'm not a fan of corn meal mush to begin with. Frying it after the initial cooking process is fine, but this version was dense and tasteless. When I order the signature dish at a restaurant, I expect to be blown away. That was not the case with this mediocre mushroom melange. Frankly, the Sauteed Mushrooms side dish at Durant's is better because those mushrooms are well-season and not enveloped in a sauce that masks the nuances of their individual flavors. The portion was more generous and the BF and I split reasonable servings for the price of this item.\n\nThe BF decided to go with the Rib-eye special ($40) as his entree. It was a huge portion with a full pound of steak. The meat was nice, but it was way too aggressively seasoned. A piece of quality meat does not need to be overwhelmed with spice. The rib-eye came with what was described as a sweet potato hash. Coincidentally, the BF makes a superb sweet potato hash that is on the order of caramelized sweet potato home fries. The version at Cowboy Ciao was really lumpy mashed sweet potatoes with nothing approaching the texture of a hash. There is no excuse for lackluster side dishes.\n\nI ordered the Slow-Roasted Short Ribs ($31). The portion of meat was generous, but not enormous like the BF's steak. I liked the dried cherry BBQ sauce that was presented on the side. The meat was fork-tender and made even more delicious when dipped into the tangy sauce. The side dishes were again disappointing. The pecan grits were utterly flavorless and the pan-fried vegetables needed seasoning. Hiding the vegetables under the huge lump of grits was a less than stellar presentation.\n\nOur meal was not thrilling. Since that it what the restaurant aims to achieve, it was a disappointment. When we have a hankering for this genre of food again, we'll make our way to The Roaring Fork.\n\nCiao, Cowboy Ciao."""""""
Four,"Good meeting rooms and attentive staff for our 20 person event.  Centrally located off the highway and free parking.  Granted, some of the Phoenix traffic can be rough.  The banquet captain had everything set up for our event by 8:00 pm the night before.  Food and coffee was ready to go when our first participant showed up.  \n\nBasically, I could focus on my job at hand and not have to chase down the little things, like is there sugar for the coffee?  \n\nI like both the Marriott and the Hyatt Place close to the Phoenix airport.  I would have an event at either again.  Wouldn't second guess the Marriott."
Five,"I spent a lot of time shopping to find the best carpet I could buy for the lowest price. I looked at several companies on Craigslist and even tried to buy the carpet and pad myself and just have a different installer put the carpet in for me. I wish I came across these guys earlier in my search process. Not only did they get me a much better carpet than I originally was looking for but the total for carpet, pad, and installation was much less than what it would have been for much lower grades of carpet than I was looking for. The quality of the installation was great! I would highly recommend them for any carpet installation that you have."
Four,"Love, love, LOVE Costco! I could spend days in there, just soaking up the deals. You can buy such a large variety of products here, ranging from: travel to furniture, movie tickets to bulk flowers. The booze is cheap and the food high quality. My husband and I often purchase their parmesan spinach dip for entertaining and their croissants and rotisserie chickens for meals throughout the week. These are the absolute best chickens that we have bought at a store...no grocery store or KFC can compare. There may be an annual membership fee, but it pays for itself if you buy 10 or so items per year. The only downside...you must use debit, cash, or American Express."
Two,"I love Weinerschnitzel, but this location is FAIL.\n\nI went in with a coupon for lunch as I was working down by ASU that day. I placed my order to find out that it would have just been cheaper if I had ordered the combo instead, but then discovered that on top of it all the clerk rang me up wrong. This isn't usually a big deal, so I just asked that they correct my order to the pretzel bun chili dogs that I enjoy so very very much.\n\nShort version of the story was that the manager was rude and I had to swipe my card again for another 60-something cents for the pretzel bun upgrades. A good manager would have just done it for having screwed up my order but he copped an attitude with me as well. \n\nMaybe he mistook me for an ASU student trying to cause him trouble and not, you know, a paying customer. Who knows.\n\nJust make sure you speak slowly and make them read your order back to you (TWICE) and you should be fine."
Two,"""Two stars does feel a bit harsh for rating this place, but the description fits perfectly. \Meh. I've experienced better.\"""" Three stars would be \""""A-OK,\"""" which I don't feel describes my experience here at all.\n\nIt's not that anything was particularly bad or offensive. It just wasn't great. The roll I got before eating was harder than I would have liked, but the pesto/olive oil that came with it was quite pleasant. On the recommendation of the server, I got one of their chef's special dishes, the Ciambotta Di Pollo e Salsiccia. Again, nothing was wrong with it. It was good and I plowed my way through it quickly. However, it was far from gourmet. The sauce, while it tasted fine, was hardly distinguishable from something from a jar. The chicken and peppers were roughly cut in all sizes. Then the biggest problem with the whole experience was the price. For my lunch of only iced tea and an entree, I paid just over $20 after tax and tip. Now I don't have a problem with paying $20 for a meal, not at all. But for that price, I expect quality. What I got did not at all match up with that expectation.\n\nI have nothing against this restaurant. I wasn't at all put off by the meal. But I can get better at Olive Garden for a lower price. I can call to mind several family-owned Italian restaurants with higher quality and lower prices. So I'll be taking my money to those."""""""

They have happy hour EVERY DAY from 2:30pm to close... AWESOME! They do close earlier than most places (I believe they close at 9pm) but they wait for the crowd to die down before last call, so it could be a bit after 9 if there are still people enjoying themselves. Their food is good bar food and the service was quick and efficient. Although we didn't go back for it, it looks like they have a pretty sweet setup for football Sundays too.

One,"""I was so angry when I left this place. I take my tea very seriously! A friend of mine ordered a nice looseleaf white tea, which was okay, I guess.

I took one sip and it tasted familiar -- LIKE THE COSTCO CHAI TEA MIX I HAVE AT HOME & AT WORK. I was outraged. I was paying like five dollars for this supposed ~Masala chai.

They said they used a \""""sweetening mix\"""" with honey, etc. I asked to see it, and they showed me a bucket of light brown powder which looked an awful lot like the chai mix you buy at Costco.

Three,"El Encanto is one of those old-time restaurants of Arizona. As Durant's Steakhouse, McAlpine, Tee Pee, Sugar Bowl, Red Devil, all have roots in Arizona dating back decades. \n\nThe food at El Encanto is good overall, with a few small overlooked details. First, the Carnitas can be a bit on the fatty side. Second, when the food arrives, don't expect it all to be served at the same time. I was dining the other evening at El Encanto, a table of 5, it took 3 trips to serve us all, over the course of 5 minutes. \n\nThe margaritas tend to be a bit thin as well, they need to adopt a recipe that requires more then a margarita mixer and tequila. Fresh lime juice is always a great place to start!\n\nI do enjoy the space itself, very relaxing, great restaurant to go and chill with friends. The menu has had an overhaul in the past year, reducing it to a fraction of what it was. My advice, expand the menu to not include just the Sonora stuff (tacos, enchiladas, etc) but add some items that you can't get on every corner in Phoenix. Overall a slightly above average experience."
Three,"The food quality was excellent as usual. I like Genghis SO much better than YC's because of the freshness of the meat.  At YC's it's always frozen.  While it's kind of gross to see raw meat out, it is always kept cold and is much better than the frozen meats at YCs.\n\nThis restaurant hasn't been in this location very long. It used to be a My Big Fat Greek Restaurant. I am glad to see that there is a Genghis Grill close to my location. However in this new location, it seems that they need to improve on some things. The atmosphere wasn't great nor did it do anything great for the experience.  They have several flat screen tv's and the music was quite loud.  It was almost too loud for a restaurant atmosphere.\n\nThere was a considerable wait for the server to come with our beverages and then consistently over the course of our meal, our server was rarely seen and quite slow. \n\nAfter we received our beverages but before we went through the line, we saw a large roach crawling on the floor next to our table.  My husband told another server who took care of the problem and then told the manager. It took a little while for me to get my appetite back but once I did we proceeded quickly through the line.\n\nThe line, again had great food albeit a bit messy and the handles on the spoons for serving the food were sticky.\n\nAfter our meal, it took a very long time to get the check. We first requested it from the manager and then from another server than our own and then finally from the manager again.  It was almost 15 minutes before we received it.\n\nWhile the food was good, I was disappointed with the service and atmosphere.  I really like Genghis and want it to be good.  The location at Tempe Marketplace is better for cleanliness and service."
Five,"My second visit today was a good as my first! Yummy fast food & I don't feel bad eating it! Plus, it's great quality. Staff is friendly which is also a plus. \nFirst time I went, I ordered a breakfast sandwich. Yummm.\nThis time I ordered the Hummus Plate. It came with veggies and warm flat bread. Veggies were crispy, flat bread was soft, and hummus was smooth and creamy. \nOnly downside is that they're only open until 4.\nNeedless to say, I will definitely be a regular!"
Two,"""i almost died of dehydration...water, water everywhere, and not an attentive server in sight. i blame this on howard B. who could not get his A in gear. i guess the fact that my party of one waiting to double proved to puzzle the pita peddlers, one asked me if i had been helped and i said no, but i was waiting for someone... so no rush...she asked if i would like a drink and i said i would love an iced tea. it must have been a survey because she never came back. i chatted with the ducks for awhile, evidently people in chandler do not talk to ducks, i think that is speciesist, but understandable because i eventually grew tired of their complaining about obamacare and intellectual property laws..i decided that i wanted to eat them, luckily howard arrived to talk me out of it. yay service...\n\nno, not yet. only when I exclaimed \what is going on here?\"""" in reference to something typically unsavory, did our hot pants waitress take notice. being loud does pay....blue corn nachos and lavosh shawarma subbing out the greek salad for taboule of course. i love taboule and pita jungle does it well so one star for the taboule. the blue corn nachos were meh (sorry howard) but the ducks enjoyed them. there is a woman who works here who takes a bit of enjoyment from scaring the ducks away by whipping a blue cloth at them, and hey...not so nice lady. ducks love chicken..did you know? this bothers me a little but makes me happy to like chicken as well. so the the other star is for the ducks. to the lady who scares the ducks...i got a warm tingle in my heart when you stepped in the duck poo. quack"""""""

Four,"""Came here with my man's family on Christmas Eve night. \n\nLet me start by saying that our waiter (Owen) was one of THE BEST waiters i have ever had. He was very friendly, always on top of it, and very helpful with recommendations. \n\nHere's what we had and what i recommend: \n\nEntrees: \n\nMe: New Zealand Lamb Loin - TO DIE FOR! They usually make it medium-rare, but i am not a fan of bloodiness, so when i asked if i could get it medium-well instead, the response was \Absolutely!\"""" The meat was cooked perfectly and the artichoke risotto was fantastic! \n\nMy Man, Man's Sister, Man's Dad: Puerco Lento - the pork was so tender and was falling of the bone. The sauce it came with was delicious. Everybody loved it. My man enjoyed it so much he finished The Sister's leftover meat. \n\nMan's Mom: Exotic Mushroom Pan Fry - our friendly and helpful waiter Owen recommended she gets the small one because the big one is apparently really big. Boy, the small one was so huge we could only guess how big the big one would have been... \n\nDessert: \n\nThe Man, Man's Dad: Breakfast of The Champions - i had a couple bites - absolutely delicious! \n\nMan's Sister & Mom: shared the pudding - had a bite as well - very yummy! \n\nMyself: Cheesecake - pretty darn good! \n\nI must also add that the wine was fantastic, and while Me & The Sister had a glass of red & white, The Dad ordered a flight of red - there was more than plenty of wine in that flight! \n\nThe only small disappointment i had was the ciabatta bread - it was fresh and delicious but i thought there was too little of it. \n\nThe design of the place is very unique and the menu is very funky. With superb food and fabulous service this place certainly has a great atmosphere. I will definitely go back next time we visit my man's folks!"""""""
Three,"Why do people love this place?  MommaKat insisted on snacking here after a hard day of shopping, and I am not impressed.

It was like pulling teeth.. no seriously, no cheese.  and I want this dressing not that dressing.  \n\nWe stood in line for over 20 minutes at 4pm on a Saturday.  There were 2 couples in front of us.  LAME.\n\nThere were no forks, and the cashier forgot to give me my brownie, and i thought he was going to have a conniption when I asked twice.\n\nBathrooms were very nice and clean though.  Outdoor seating is very limited. \n\nLame excuse for a panera-"
Four,"This is my go-to place for a Margarita and good Mexi food within biking/walking distance. \n\nWhat we love: \n\nFresh chips and salsa, and the bean dip served with is dee-lish \n\nBIG, CHEAP Margs. Try the Mango, Peach, Mango/Peach. :) \n\nFish Tacos. I had never had them before and they were very good. On Wednesdays they are only $0.99! \n\nGreat enchiladas, cheese crisps, and pork tacos as well \n\nFriendly service. The servers are always impressed (or act that way) when Nico uses his Spanish on them. \n\nIt's nothing fancy or will win any interior decor awards, but we love coming here for a fun experience and always get out of there without spending a ton of dough. Muy bien!"
Four,"I was out shopping with my 16 year old son, and we decided to stop in and try America's. The delightful young lady behind the counter highly suggested that we try at least one thing with the pastor filling so we ordered the meal for two for $20. That comes with chips and salsa, two burritos, two tacos and two drinks The carne asada was very good...but OMG...the pastor was amazing! We just wished we had ordered the burrito with the pastor and the taco with the carne asada instead of the other way around. The sweet young thing kept checking in on us...we were there at 3 in the afternoon so it was quiet...but gosh, the young girls had just been fawning over us all day! On the way home, I looked at my kiddo and realized he's pretty darn good looking...so maybe that explains all the delightful customer service that day! Anyway, I can understand some of the complaints about it being a little pricey, but I think you are really getting a quality product and that is worth it to me. Plus, I thought the burrito was especially meaty. And as a carnivore I totally appreciate getting my meat on! Cute place, yummy food, fun day out with the teenager. Really, you can't ask for more than that."
Five,"It is not often that you run across a hidden gem such as this during the weekly business travels.  Today I did just that.  I stumbled into Il Bosco Pizza in Scottsdale, AZ.  I was greeted at the door by the owner/ Bill Forrest.  I received nothing but wonderful hospitality throughout my dining experience from both Bill and Barbara as well as some entertaining dialog with the kitchen team (a penquin tattoo, really?).\nThe wine list was well thought out with very reasonable by the glass and bottle prices.  The menu selection was focused.  By that I mean, it stayed true to what they do and they do it well.  Too often you find the restaurant that wants to be everything to everybody.  Not here.  They do pizza very well.  I have traveled to Italy many times in my career and this place nails it.  Great dough coupled with the finest of ingredients, prepared in a minimalist style that lets the food do the talking.  I am truly impressed.  I will be back often.  I hope for Bill and Barbara that this is a hit but deep down I love the hidden gem.  \nIf you are a foodie and love food without pretense, you will love Il Bosco.  This is a foodie find.  I am a chef and I absolutely love this place.  You will not be disappointed.  \nCheers,"
Five,"""Besides the original location in Brooklyn, this is the Grimaldi's location that started the love affair for me.  I'll never forget driving down Scottsdale Road in May 2006, days after I moved into town from Washington, DC and I saw the Grimaldi's sign.  I thought, \Could it be?  Could Grimaldi's from Brooklyn actually have opened up a new location?!?\""""  Sure enough, I learned that they sold the recipe to a company that is opening up franchises (something like that) of the pizzeria.  I was thrilled!  Tasted it and was even more thrilled to see it tasted so similar to the Brooklyn location.  \n\nI have been to four locations around the Valley and each one makes excellent thin crust coal burning oven pizza.  Totally top notch!  Best pizza in AZ hands down!  \n\nMy favorite Grimaldi's pizza: Large with pepperoni, sausage, and basil (baked in).  Can't go wrong.\n\nAlso, their \""""small\"""" salads are big enough to share."""""""
Five,"When cowboys ride off into the sunset, they probably stop at Greasewood Flat for a burger and beer. This rustic little bar is located a bit outside the city right near Pinnacle Peak and is definitely worth the drive! You'll know you are in the right spot when you see the antique farm equipment and suddenly feel like you are walking up to an Old West saloon. Say hello to the mule on your way in. Outside they have picnic tables, horseshoes, and fire pits (gets chilly out there in the desert!), and on the weekends they have live music and dancing. \n\nInside, the bar is pretty small, and the place is covered in dollar bills and business cards left by satisfied cowboys and cowgals. For the nights without live music, don't you fret, they have a jukebox with tons of country hits. The night we went it was the bartender's birthday, and the regulars were definitely having a good time.  \n\nBoth a historic landmark (120+-year old original stagecoach stop) and a dive bar, Greasewood Flat is clearly special to Arizona, and is a definite must see. I'll be going back on a weekend to get the true Greasewood Flat experience and hopefully see a cute cowboy or two.."
Three,"On the way over I was arguing with my wife on the phone.  When I got there I was all pumped up.  I ordered the salad bar.  \n\nMy friend ordered a tuna sandwich.  We both had water.\n\nI made a pretty basic salad: iceberg, greens and baby spinach; red onion; olives; pumpernickel croutons; other things and balsamic vinagrette.  Those little ginger muffins they have are siq.  I had a bunch of them.\n\nI spilled my guts to my homie about my situation.  He listened pretty well.

One,"""April 19, 2011, btwn 1:30p.m - 2p.m, I drove thru Wendys drive thru and ordered #3.

Four,"""What fun! We had a great dinner at our first visit to Noca and thoroughly enjoyed the taste, presentation and unique flair of the food. The cuisine was creative yet yet still harmonious, fresh and high quality. A culinary adventure (in a  good way) - we couldn't wait to experiencet each course. \n\nAfter we ordered we received two complementary treats - first a gazpacho \granita\"""" (like a tomato icee with basil oil) and a cold fresh pea soup. Both excellent and perfectly refreshing. For starters, my husband got the cold corn soup, which was naturally sweet, rich and luscious. I had the squash blossoms stuffed with ricotta and fried tempura style. Excellent, though I think I'd like anything cheesy and done tempura style, so maybe I should have tried something a little less conventional. \n\nWe then shared a large raviolo with duck egg in the center and rich lobster sauce with mushrooms. Delectable; and I'm glad we shared because it was quite rich and filling. The serving temperature was luke warmish - I'm not sure if that was by design, but it would have been even better piping hot. \n\nOur main courses were scallops for me and sliced rolled beets stuffed with cheese for my husband. The scallops were done just right, and nicely salty (too much so for my husband's taste by I loved it). The beet dish was a play on a \""""pasta\"""" dish with beets instead of pasta. The sweetness of the beets was nicely offset by the bitterness of broccoli rabe. \n\nBy the time we got through all this (OK I had to have some of the scallop dish packed to go), we were stuffed but were dying to see what they could do with the desserts. A complementary bowl of green apple cotton candy kept us entertained while we perused the dessert menu. If we had listened to our stomachs we would have stopped there, but the taste buds were in charge by that time. The lemon tart was a wonderful. The donuts were, well ... donuts. I personally think that's a good thing (mmmm...donuts), but next time I'll try a more creative selection. \n\nOn a Thursday evening we found the place less than half full so apparently weeknight crowds are hit or miss. The interior decor is spare yet comfortable. Until sundown the natural light through the windows is bright enough to make the interior a bit harsh and difficult to focus. I generally love lots of natural light, so I don't know why I found the lighting here so difficult.  prices are fairly high, and I'm not surprised considering the uniquness of each dish - many items are locally sourced and and are clearly albor intensive.  Regarding the of the dishes, I would be nicely sated with an appetizer and an entree, or only an entree for a light meal.  The multi-course feast I described here had me uncomfortably full, and I'm not a skimpy eater.  We aready have reservations to try one of their tasting dinners."""""""

Five,"""On the night of a show at The Clubhouse, I went to a record store to pick up the tickets. I had researched restaurants close to the venue on Yelp before I left and decided on Boulders. I asked one of the record  store clerks whether he had been there, and he said he had. I asked if he liked it, and he said he didn't. When I asked why, he said \It's just not really my scene.\"""" He then followed up with, \""""Are you into like, craft beers, and like indie rock, mountain biking, that kind of thing?\"""" Umm, yeah, pretty much. \""""Then you'll like it.\""""\n\nThis is my new place.

It was thin crust, which reminded me of Rosati's, although it could have used some more sauce (maybe I'll ask for extra next time). \n\nThe beer selection is awesome - just about every awesome IPA (I prefer hoppy stuff) that I could think of. If I remember right, there were like 20 or 30 on draft. Such a relief when the fanciest beer I can get at a lot of restaurants I go to is Sam Adams, Fat Tire, or Guinness. We were talked into a skillet cookie to top it off - not something I'd do every time, but well worth it.\n\nI love this place, and I will surely be coming back."""""""

The beef was also powdery.  Not sure what is going on with this, but it is not good.  We also ordered Chicago style hot dogs.  They are not Chicago style which is what I would expect from a company that is from Chicago.  It did not have a poppy seed bun.  It did not have a pickle spear.  It did not have tomatoes."

One,"So we walked into this place around 6pm.. it was SO hot and humid in there it was barely tolerable. After we were sat this baby started screaming and puking all over the mother, the table, itself.. was pretty disgusting. After getting over that the waitress brought over menu and chips and salsa. Took one bite of the salsa, that was it.. out of here. The salsa here is from a can.. tasted like tin with some added cumin. The chips were cold, greasy, stale and soggy form the humidity. Threw a buck in the table and walked out. \n\nPerhaps its better in the winter time sans the swamp coolers and the puking baby?"
Two,"I went to Macayo's with my brother in law and nephew.  The restaurant was selected by my bother-in-law.  We arrived at about 2:00, after the lunch rush, and the restaurant was mostly empty.  But that didn't mean we got our choice of tables.  All the booths were empty and un-bussed, so we ended up sitting at a table.  The waitress came by quickly to get our drink orders, but it took longer than expected to get the drinks to our table.  Chips and salsa was delivered.  Two salsas; one somewhat chunky, but rather mild, and the second one spicier, but very runny.  The chips were good though.  \n\nI ordered the red chili burro, enchilada style.  The burrito was one of the worst burritos I've had.  It was salty, and without any sense of seasoning.  I guess this is what I should expect when I allow my brother-in-law select a restaurant.  He dislikes any sense of spice.  Service was a bit slow for drinks, but the food did arrive quickly.\n\nOverall, I would never recommend this Macayo's.  Too bland and tasteless like too many chain restaurants."
Five,"I stopped in here because I hate tea but I really want to like it. The atmosphere was nice and the employees were friendly. When I explained that I never drink tea, they made me something fruity and delicious that has made me determined to go back and be a little more daring. \n\nThe only problem: I wish they had a little more space to accommodate groups. And I wish they opened a little earlier, so I could stop in before work!\n\nRegarding the other reviews, it -does- seem kind of out of place. But I appreciate that there are some locally-owned businesses in a shopping mall like Tempe Marketplace (I think the clothing boutique next door to Tea Infusion is an Arizona-owned business, as well)."

BUT, that has nothing to do with their food.  I love the garlic and sweet potato fries.  The blue burger is also delicious and the burger was juicy as they should be.  I recently had the Ahi Tune sandwich and LOVED it.  It was different than what I normally get and a GOOD different.

I could eat one of these every day!\n\nThe location is very convenient for light rail, and is close enough to downtown.\n\nThe beer selection was \ok, the drunken italian soda was really nice, and sneaks up on you, but the Caipirinhas were simply fantastic.\n\nI'm thinking I may have to try their brunch, before I make a solid determination about our future together.\n\nBut I really enjoyed the TweetUp, and my impression of Switch moved up quite a bit."""""""
One,"""My thought: \someone rescue me from the rude, crazy behemoth lady!!!\""""\n\nI guess I should start from the beginning.

Four,"""Today was our first time eating at Jim's.  We have been living in this area for 3 years and I cannot BELIEVE we have overlooked this place!\n\n1.)

Five,"Thanks to Yelp we found this hidden gem! It's about 20 minutes outside of Phoenix but worth every mile drive from Sedona. We were craving authentic Chinese cuisine -- specifically hand pulled noodles and dumplings and we found Chou's Kitchen.\nLike some of the other Yelpers have said, please do a flash mob here to support local businesses. The owner lady is friendly and helpful with the dish recommendations. Please see my pics of the yummy pan fried beef buns, green onion pancakes, freshly made napa cabbage and pork dumplings, and the cold salad appetizer of parsley, green onions and jalape\u00f1os. Once seated, you will get a complimentary bowl of cornmeal porridge (very typical in Beijing cuisine). We would definitely come back if we are ever in the area."
Two,"As we were at the Montelucia resort for the night we figured we would check out their 'Slow Movement' restaurant Prado. Well slow service just what we received. The place was busy (not jammed) and the waiters just couldn't cope, The service was painfully slow and our guy was frankly jaded. He said all the right things but you didn't believe a word of it.\n\nI had some delicious scallops but with polenta that was essentially fancy grits. I have tasted much better elsewhere. I went on to lamb for my entree which was OK, but again just OK. \n\nTo top off the evening our red wine was served at room temperature and I mean Arizona with no AC room temperature! Not good. \n\nI would pass on this place and if you are staying at the otherwise excellent resort. Jump in a cab and head to the nearby excellent Tarbells on Camelback Road."

The table next to us, with a full great view, stayed vacant the entire time we were there.  I'm assuming they like to keep diners together.  \n\nMy halibut with laughing bird shrimp and peruvian purple potatoes was to die for, I ate the whole thing.  My husband was just okay with his veal cheeks, didn't care for the sauce and wished he had ordered the halibut too.

Four,"I've been going to BJ's Restaurant since i was a little girl and i'm really glad that it is still around.

The.y have several screens, so we were able to watch several games at once and were were lucky enough that there was one booth left at the bar.  We ordered half pepperoni and half buffalo which is one of my favorites and of course the artichoke and spinach dip.  Our pizza arrive and it was perfectly fine but our server thought it was overcooked and surprised us with a whole new pizza without warning.  We had originally ordered a large and we think he misunderstood and brought us a medium, but he ended up bringing a whole other one without even asking.  We left with our stomach's full otherwise we would have ordered a pazzooki...darn."
Four,"Wow.  Julie D. must not drive much.  Or travel.  I find this hotel just fine.\n\nI was greeted by a very friendly person who was willing to valet my car.  I could have parked it- I'm not scared of parking garages, but I like valet convience.  No issues with the guy parking the car, or getting it back in the mornings.  Service was quick and friendly.\n\nThe rooms are nice.  Very spacious.  Nice lay-out.  Nice balcony.  Nice big TVs. \n\nThe room was very clean, and maintained well during my stay.  \n\nThe front desk folks were very friendly.  I checked in and out with no issues.  Very speedy.\n\nThe breakfast is good.  Buffett is OK, but a bit pricey.  menu items are a better option...  \n\nPool is nice, and the work out room is pretty hotel-standard.

Four,"If you know what to expect, don't complain.\n\nOK, it's Americanized sushi. But that's like its own type of cuisine now, so get over it. Don't expect a great sashimi creation, just come and order the rolls that sound like the most fun (a Tootsie Roll? no, it's not from Japan. duh.). Come at happy hour and they're pretty cheap.\n\nIt's a fun atmosphere, so expect a hip crowd. Waitresses who use their looks to make up for being bad servers. (Who cares?) A young, fun crowd with good drinks and good Americanized sushi.\n\nThe Yelp reviews on this place are pretty mixed. I'm guessing it's just the divide between people who knew what to expect on the one hand, and people who expected something different on the other."
Two,"""I've been to several TRHs a few times with my family, and for a chain, it's not bad.  Not great, but not bad.  The steaks have always been competently done, as well as the shrimp I usually get with them.  I enjoy the fried pickles way more than they deserve considering the health benefits.  They are also the only meat-oriented restaurant I know of that serves a few genuine options for vegetarians, an important consideration for my family.\n\nThe bigger problem is with the service, something a chain usually does better. Table service is friendly, but always rushed.  I understand they are busy, but I don't like being considered an annoyance by my server.  The front staff at the Gilbert store is particularly unpleasant, it appears they hire only \mean girls\"""" for the desk.  They will not even acknowledge your presence until they finish their conversation (work-related or not), and if you are not a good-looking young man, you get at best indifferent and often downright rude treatment.\n\nDon't ever let them sit you in the bar area.  Those tables are waited by the bar staff, who also have to tend bar, and usually don't have time to do either.  You won't enjoy your dinner if you are seated there.  If you ever get it.\n\nIf we have a big group and are looking for something easy and affordable we will wind up at THR.  As long as you know what your are getting, it's fine."""""""
Two,"This place is a TV Time Machine to the 80's.  Tons upon tons upon assloads upon bajillions of TV's in this place . . . sadly 95% of them are old tubes or old projection TV's.  Thumbs up though for how willing they were to change a TV to the game you wanted.\n\nNot much for outside patio TV's though.  I think three total, and poorly angled.  Angel matters.\n\nThe food was standard bar fare.  The wings though were excellent, some of the best I've had . . . well cooked and plenty of sauce.

Four,"I have only spent a couple hours at this hotel and it was for a photoshoot. The staff was great towards us and gave us a lot of access. We used the roof and the pool area and then the parking structure outside. The roof looks like it'd be really cool at night to have some drinks and look out onto the city. The morning sunrise views were great. The pool was awesome. I loved the style, very funky with cool colored tiles and an interesting layout with a waterfall over the glass wall. I loved the look of this retro hotel. The rooms weren't big but comfy and they continued that retro look through the elevators, window shades and all. The restaurant down stairs looks busy so I totally plan on coming back to this place soon :)"
Three,"I heard good things about this bar from like five different people so I decided to check it out last night. We went around 9:00 so it was pretty slow still. But the Bartender informed us that it picks up around 10:30 and that the weekend are always busy. The jukebox was rad. The owner also owns TT. But the music selection here was a bit mellow. Not so much punk rock. But we were able to select the Specials, Buzzcocks, Smiths etc. Also the bar was refreshingly clean. It smelled a bit like disinfectant actually! Anyway, this is my neighborhood bar and I'll be going back."
Three,"I'm somewhat surprised by the low stars Nellie's has received so far.  The service we experienced was both quick and attentive.  The drinks were always refilled and the food came out quickly.  \n\nI am only giving them 3 stars for the price.  I ordered the ahi tuna lunch special which sounded tempting.  Unfortunately for $15 there were only 2 pieces of fish about the size of an orange slice.  The greens and dressing that accompanied the tuna were tasty but clearly covered up the taste of the tuna itself.  Not bad at all, but not worth $15.  \n\nThe free bread is tremendous.  Brushed with olive oil and rosemary, grilled and served with a delicious spread.  \n\nAlso, the view can't be beat.  If you can, eat outside when it's not too hot.  You won't be sorry."
Three,"here's the deal: if you come here expecting berthillon, you will be disappointed.  if you come here expecting very fine american style gelato, you'll probably leave very very happy.  \n\ni came somewhere in the middle---i recognize that i can't get a certain quality of gelato this side of the atlantic, but i was expecting a little bit more.  the choc was milk choc.  gelato ought to be made with dark choc.  i'm not sure i'd trust the fruity gelato, knowing it won't compare to france/italy.  but, i bet the nutella is great---i'll try that next time!"

We ordered one to share and I still couldn't eat the whole thing.\n\nThe King Carlos V is the largest sandwich I've ever had, and the layer upon layers of food is endless.  There is breaded chicken, beef, ham, egg, cheese, avocado, tomato, lettuce, mexican sausage, mozzarella and it goes on and on.  It is served with chips and by cutting it into smaller bites, I was able to tackle some of it, but eventually, I had to abandon the bun and just pick apart the layers.  I finally surrendered and quite altogether.  \n\nThe sandwich was really good, the different layers eaten together were good, however, it is just way too much.  There is a large menu with many other delicacies awaiting another visit.  Good service, very crowded, many locals!"
Five,"I've been meaning to make it out to Haus Murphy's for a long time, but it is just so far away from the East Valley where I live.

So today when I was in the neighborhood, I decided to swing by to re-live the good old days I spent in Austria and Germany.\n\nI stopped in for lunch and had the Paprika Schnitzel with German Potato Salad. It tasted exactly as I remember it from Germany and Austria. \n\nThe service was prompt and thorough (Thanks, Tara!), and the atmosphere took me back. - A little slice of Germany in old-town Glendale."
Three,"""A friend introduced me to this place for lunch. the other day and I'm so glad he did. It's off the beaten path but that doesn't seem to have hurt their traffic.

The tuna is mixed with diced celery and sweet pickles, and it comes with bacon and Swiss (I 86ed the tomatoes ... big surprise). The french fries were fantastic! My friend went with the Thursday lunch special, which was beef burgundy tips over egg noodles (aka stroganoff), and didn't say a word from the time he leaned until his plate until it was all but licked clean. \n\nDrinks are self serve and I like that they brew their own ice tea - it's the good dark, teeth-staining ice tea that I loooooove.\n\nTo call this place a \greasy spoon\"""" wouldn't do it justice.

One,"Oh God, this place was awful. This is hands down the worst Korean food I have tasted in my life (no exaggeration). This is what Korean food would probably taste like in rural North Dakota (no offense, North Dakotans!). I really have nothing good to say about this place. \n\nThis place is expensive and serves significantly smaller portions than typical korean restaurants. The $15 seafood pancake (which had very little seafood and  tasted very fishy/gross) was half the size of what would typically served. The $10 soft tofu stew was bland and came in a very small pot (almost like a small bowl); the beef in there was extremely tough.\n\nOur server (very likely the owner) was inattentive and stingy with side dishes; we had to ask him to refill twice because it was simply not enough. The portions started off small, but only got smaller and smaller as we asked for more.\n\nIf you want decent korean food, drive a few miles south to Hodori."
Five,"""Each of the three visits I've had to this Garden has been a great experience. The first time was to see the Chihuly glass sculpture exhibit with a visiting friend from the northeast -- what a great way to show off the beauty of the desert landscape without having to leave the city! The second visit was for the incomparable event, Yelp in Bloom; I won't say any more of that here, as I've already written a review for it. The third visit was two weeks ago, when I came here to take photographs for my desert nature picture portfolio. That was the longest visit of all, and I almost ran out of memory in my digital camera because of the almost endless variety of plants, landscapes, and details in this Garden that made for stunning photographs. This longer, more leisurely visit also enabled me to explore the areas that explain the different  Arizona \biomes\"""" and the use of desert resources by the Native people of the area in the past. \nSpending all that time walking around the Garden can build up an appetite, so I was glad to be able to go to the Patio Cafe for refreshment, as well as to see flocks of Gambel's quail - normally elusive birds - approach the tables and the people, hoping to get handouts. http://media1.ct.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/LNVOHaDpj0Ka3y4lvpHbvw/l Take note: you're not supposed to feed wild animals, but it was really nice to be able these beautiful birds so close up.\nThis Garden is a true gem, and you can even get free admission if you use the Culture Pass (which I did) available from the Phoenix Library system."""""""
Two,"I really wish I could give this place a better review, since I see it has many raving reviews, but I just didn't have that great of an experience. I love trying new places and I especially love a good sandwich so I purchased a Groupon for lunch and decided since it was close by, I'd check it out. I liked that it was in downtown Mesa and had a cute concept with the whole picnic theme so I was looking forrward to something a little different. Parking is pretty limited, I got a spot on the side of the building but there wasn't a whole lot of other places to park other than the street.\n\nIt wasn't very busy during the lunch rush but I still waited about 20 minutes to get my food. I only ordered the caprese sandwich and a fruit cup so I was surprised it took as long as it did since they aren't actually cooking anything I ordered, just putting it together. Then, when I saw the size of my fruit cup, my jaw dropped open. It was literally the size of a cup you put ketchup or another condiment inside. I think total there were two pieces of strawberry and a few grapes. Sorry but if I didn't have a Groupon, I would have went up to the counter and asked for my money back on that alone! Then, when I tasted the sandwich, it really wasn't anything special.\n\nI remember leaving disappointed and didn't feel like it was a good value at all. I also felt like the menu is pretty limited and there really wasn't a lot on there I would be interested in eating (and I am by no means a picky eater). Overall, not a place I enjoyed."
Three,"""\Keegan's Grill...seriously?\"""" That was my response when I was asked to go to Keegan's Grill for lunch Sunday afternoon. Typically I won't step foot in an American chain restaurant. You know the ones - who serve uninspired bar food and sing happy birthday songs. \n\nKeegan's Grill is different. There are only 3 in the area and compared to the American chain restaurants, who serve @$@! bar food, they have a decent menu. \n\nThey take pride in their homemade soups, which I was drawn to. I ordered their onion soup. The base had pretty good flavor, the onions were nicely caramelized, the crouton was just the right size, topped with just enough cheese, and most importantly, it was served piping hot. \n\nI'm not sure if Keegan's Grill is the kind of place where I will plan in advance to go, but overall it was pretty good."""""""
Four,"Wowie what an amazing pizzeria! These guys know how to handle ingredients well and employ them in amazing ways to create an absolutely phenomenal pie!

I know, I had to swallow a lot of pride to accept that but it is truth!\n\nMy Fallen Angel pizza with its yummy sausage just paled in comparison to my companions' vegetarian orders. The Mother Earth pizza is rife with just awesome vegetable ingredients and flavors. It was like a beautiful medley of music when I bit into a slice of that!\n\nAnd the Rocketman with its garlic infusions, that was just clutch! I am in love with this pizzeria and cannot wait to go back!"
Five,"Hubby and I were invited to join a friend for a seafood grilling class and wine tasting, what better way to spend an early Saturday afternoon? \n\nIt was an intimate setting, three or four tables of people, everyone was friendly and interested in learning some new techniques.

The waiter was also well-educated when he spoke about the wines. \n\nI hope they have another class soon on how to grill the best steak!"
Five,"BEST. Sunday. Brunch. Ever. Their super pricey seasonal brunch does not start until October, so our experience was the $22 with the $8 unlimited champagne option. Best $30 I have ever spent! Our server was extremely nice and accommodating the entire time we were there which was from 10:30 until they closed around 1:00pm and even helped us move inside when it got too hot outside.  \n\nAll of the food is insanely delicious. The man behind the counter will make you pancakes, waffles, omelets all any way you desire! The warm cheese blintzes are to die for. The fruit is super fresh and delicious too and I can not WAIT to go back when it cools off a bit and enjoy the delightful scenery surrounding the patio."
Five,"""Everyone knows that Tony Soprano didn't die, HBO merely made the ending ambiguous so that America would be shielded from the awful truth that he was planning to move away from the East Coast to none other than Scottsdale, Arizona. Why you ask? Because where else can you carry on business dealings in a strip joint, be involved in \waste management\"""", act out of control all the time, philander, defraud the government...and fit right in? But for he and many other recent transplants from Jersey, the truth is part of Scottsdale's allure rests with places like DeFalco's Italian Grocery.\n\nSitting in a worn strip mall in an older section of town, the scene almost evokes a little hint of the Garden State. However, the good news is that I've never seen anyone whacked in the spacious parking lot...or wearing a Members Only jacket for that matter. Upon entering, there's a claustrophobic sensation as you see the grocery aisles creating a slightly labyrinthine path to the deli counters, which are separate based on ordering prepared or raw food. Upon reaching the prepared food aisle, you'll invariably see a microcosm of Scottsdale, ranging from senior citizens to high schools girls using platinum cards to buy lunch for the whole family. (Luckily though, no sign of Carmine Gotti just yet.) \n\nThe menu? It's a pageant of sumptuous meats and cheeses, and they even offer I-talian soda to go with. It's so good, you might think like many a famous eatery it's a front for the local outfit. While I don't believe that to be true...(it is Arizona after all) the owners certainly make purists and old school Italian food fans happy with its inclusion of more traditional meat choices like capacollo. The food also will seem dry, but that's only because they are careful not to drown out the meat's character with too much mayo or other condiments. Some may not like it.\n\nPrice-wise, this place is pretty much a steal. It's a shade more expensive than Subway, but not much more-so. But as Scottsdale goes, it's almost unbeatable. They also accept plastic and have a loyalty card, so as you can imagine, you'll want to come back often if you know what is good for you.\n\nSince it's a deli, there's no waitstaff. Still, service is total class. People are friendly, and professional so that it still feels family-owned and not corporate. The tables are usually clean in the seating area, and spaced evenly enough that you won't feel like someone just broke your legs.\n\nBut then there is the one detraction to this place: the supposedly endless wait for your order. I've never been on a weekday, but weekends I have found are pretty manageable. For some people it won't  be like Jack-in-the-Box, but if you order ahead you should avoid some of the hassle.\n\nOf course, part of the allure going to an Italian restaurant in the cultural attitude about savoring life, food and a slower pace than our Anglo-Saxon roots ultimately prefer. Unless, that is, you have reservations to Buca di Beppo...but that's another story entirely."""""""
Four,"""A nice park to take your dog!  There's a sectioned off agility area inside the fenced off dog park which also doubles as a small-dog/shy dog area if your dog needs a more structured environment.  There are various stations that hold plastic shopping bags for you to pick up after your dog (Unlike the Tempe parks where bags are supplied by the park, the park here has a \donate one, take one\"""" policy of bringing/dropping off bags). The park itself has more of an organic layout vs. the more structured design of Tempe Sports Complex, with lots of shade trees and various benches to sit on.  In the main area, there's a water fountain with some bowls and a tub of water that I saw various larger dogs hopping into to take a soak (Very cute!) My dog had fun roaming around, and got to show off how speedy he was by racing around with a 4 month old lab mix!"""""""
Five,"I can't get enough of this place. My boyfriend and I used to happily make the trek all the way from North Phoenix on a regular basis and have never been let down!\n\nWhenever I go out to eat in Tempe, specifically close to ASU, I expect half-ass service. I expect there to be hungover waitresses and hostesses texting when I walk up because in the past that's what I've come across. Though there are college students working at Republic Ramen, they have always been extremely helpful and have given us fantastic customer service despite the fact sometimes there's only one cashier/server at a time (usually during work hours on weekdays).\n\nWhat do I love most about the food at Repulic Ramen? The variety. There are several broth choices and they are happy to switch meat out for tofu. And the bowls are packed with tons of fresh veggies. I've seen a couple of complaints on here about the broth being bland - but I've never personally had that issue. Then again, I had a sh*t ton of Sriracha because it makes already phenomenal food taste THAT much better. Anyway, the bowls are huge. My boyfriend and I share one every time. And just in case we're hungrier than we thought, we always order a side of edamame or veggie tempura (if you go during happy hour it's like $1).\n\nBut my favorite FAVORITE part of RR is their boba. On the other side of the dining room is a little cafe where they serve boba, sake, coffee, etc. I've lived in North Phoenix and now I live near Central Phoenix and boba is pretty hard to come by in those parts. I'd have to drive to Chandler or the West Valley and that just won't ever happen. I almost always order thai tea milk tea w/ boba but sometimes venture out and get a peanut butter & chocolate snow (creamy slushy) and my boyfriend likes to mix fruity flavors - they have a lot of options and you can mix any of them. Their boba pearls are always soft and they are generous with the amount they put in. I don't know about you, but I hate when I eat all the boba before I'm finished with the liquid. In this case, sometimes I find myself just eating boba pearls because I've already drank all the tea.\n\nAll in all, this is probably my favorite restaurant. Does it feel like you're sitting down somewhere in Japan? No. It's definitely Tempe. It's very open and modern. But who cares because it's delicious. Fantastic food, friendly staff, clean bathrooms/tables/everything, lots of seating, and of course, boba!"
Two,"Great introductory special for a brazilian for $20 but geesh louise..painless? I did not think so! And I'm tough, and a brazilian veteran! When that wax did not want to come off it did not want to come off. I have never had a waxer rip at a strip like that ever. That kind of wax works as the strip as well, and for whatever reason it didnt want to come off in a big sensitive spot! It felt like torture while I laughed and tried not to think about it.

Three,"Aya & Peilas is new in the sense that they have re-opened since 1988.  It is on the corner of 17th Ave and Van Buren, just west of the the Circle K.\n\nA stack of menus were hand delivered by the family who owns Aya & Peilas to my office building just down the street and we went and tried it out.  We did take out, but they do phone orders and dine in.  There are about 2 booths and 2 tables in there, it's small and warm but very clean.\n\nThere were state employees inside ordering lunch to go just like we were.  A & P has some good deals on the lunch combos.  They are only $4.95.  I got the taco, enchilada and tostada.  Not bad, pretty good and for less than $5, can't beat it!  It is a glorified 'ertos type restaurant.  The family owners and employees seem very nice.  \n\nOther workies got some lunch too and they were happy with it.  It's nice to have a new spot to grab some grub while at work!\n\nOh and they have navajo tacos and Indian fry bread on the menu---- YUMMMM!"
Three,"I met my manager here for dinner (it was very nerve-wracking but that's a whole 'nother story in itself). I wanted to take her to some place that would be fun but tasty near her hotel, and Carlsbad fit the bill.\n\nSo many other reviewers have commented on the decor...yes, it's kitschy. Quite honestly though, it's unique and I love the bats. We had a great time pointing out random things on the wall.\n\nThe food was good, but I wasn't particularly wowed by my meal. My manager got the Enchantment Platter and loved it. I ordered the green chile burrito, and while it was very good, I can't say it was the greatest thing in the world. After reading the other reviews though, I can't wait to return and try other things. \n\nThe service was good, attentive and friendly. My manager is from Australia and wasn't familiar with sopapillas. The staff happily told her what the honey on the table was for. There seemed to be a decent after work group in the bar area chatting up the bartenders.\n\nI waffled between 3 and 4 stars...so 3.5 really, and I'm giving only 3 with the hopes that a return trip will be a 4 or 5 star experience."
Four,"3.5 stars, but I'll round up.  For airport food, this was a great find.  There were a number of vegetarian options, a place to sit down, and OK margaritas.  I had 2, and they each came out quite differently -- not sure why.  The lady next to me had an issue with her salad and they took care of it right away and checked in to make sure that the replacement was working.  I'd go back.  I'd like to see the food be a little spicier, but it was nicely flavored other than that."
Four,"Osha serves excellent food and is just down the street from my apartment which is awesome because aside from the usual fast food chains there aren't a lot of great restaurants in the immediate area.  I have only ordered carry out and they've always had it ready in fifteen to twenty minutes.\n\nI ordered the Tom Ka and Panang and while I prefer Thai House's panang, Osha's wasn't bad by any means.  Osha also has better hours as they are one of the only places open on Sunday."
Four,"The time was 4:30am.  It was dark and a little chilly with the sun not yet up.  Perhaps that's why they call it Black Friday, but my money was on the delicate hint of malice in the air as I stood shoulder to shoulder with  veteran soccer moms with steel and fire glinting from their eyes, Scowling teenagers and college students bubbling with nervous energy and the occasional hen-pecked dad who got talked into dealing with shopping insanity as some sort of a special treat before trudging off to the salt  mines for the day.\n\nThere were at least five hundred infantry ahead of me and five hundred behind me and our numbers kept growing.  There were scattered bits of conversation but most of us were silent, contemplating the chaos we were about to charge into for the sake of our families, our friends, our lovers.  But mostly for the sake of savings.  We glanced ahead and behind, sizing up the competition, mentally calculating our strategies for navigating the battlefield.  We were at least a battalion strong.  Perhaps a regiment by the time the doors would open.  And it would be every man woman and child for themselves.\n\nOccasionally, someone would open a wallet or a purse, checking and rechecking their ammunition, occasionally running a finger along the edge of a bank card or bill to make sure they maintained their razor edge.  Slowly, we began to march forward and the slow but steady trudge was a stark contrast to the sense of frantic urgency that crackled in the morning air.  Not all of us could walk away victors, but all of us were determined to try.\n\nThen something happened.  Something I would have never expected.  As we approached the double glass doors, we were greeted by another army.  With their bright blue uniforms, they could have been UN peacekeepers.  They handed us each a large plastic bag and ushered us into the store with bleary eyed smiles.  The fear and tension started to lift.  I have been at Toys R Us on Christmas eve.  I have seen the very worst of Holiday spirits and I was ready to face them again all for the sake of an (CENSORED) that (CENSORED) just had to have.\n\nYes the store was crowded.  But there were so many helpful, indeed cheerful sales attendants on hand that most of us shoppers just melted into a gentle wave of requests which were quickly and cheerfully met before anyone could get bent out of shape or stressed out.  A sales clerk simply asked me to wait for a moment while she located a reserve ticket for the doorbuster item I had stood in line for.  One minute and fifteen seconds later she returned with a document which guaranteed me my desired item at the desired price to be delivered to me as I left the store.  Another clerk helped me locate the other items I needed and I was done with my shopping within ten minutes.  \n\nOf course it took another hour or so to work through the serpentine line at the checkout but all of us were so relieved at how painless and indeed bloodless the shopping experience had been. We were more than happy to stand in line waiting for the opportunity to plunk down our hard earned cash on the latest objects of technolust that had caught the eyes of our loved ones.  We left tired.  And we left poor.  But I dare say most of us left happy and for that Best Buy and the entire Best Buy army have my eternal gratitude.  Thanks for taking the ass out of Christm."
Four,"The Real Deal\n\nI'm from East Tennessee and our BBQ is North Carolina style.\nAfter moving out to Tempe in '95 I thought I'd never see good BBQ but Honey Bear's changed that, they could hold their own in the South.\nHoney Bears is N Carolina -style BBQ and the real deal., not cooked with spice/sauce until you put it on the meat.\nGo for the Pork! this is what they do, skip the beef and chicken, it's for the BBQ illiterate.\nSame with the folks who complained about having to put the sauce to the meat or not having fries, you do not know Southern BBQ.\nFor those who do, enjoy!"
Three,"It was good. Very clean place, with decent service and okay prices. I had the signature Republic Ramen. It was good, but I added some spice to it. My wife and stepson enjoyed theres more than I did mine. Portions are a good size. \n\nI don't know, I thought it was good, but not great. There is nothing wrong with the place, but I doubt I will come here very often. Give it a try, by all means, but don't expect something spectacular."
Four,"I really do like this place. It's not Baker's, but seriously a close second. The plants feel a little more big box than Baker's which is why it doesn't get another star, but the space and other offerings are fabulous.\n\nIn addition, the staff is super friendly and they offer little things that make their service stand out. For example, they have these lovely little rolls of heavy gauge plastic to line your trunk or seats with, to prevent soil from getting everywhere. They have these super convenient carts that have a pivoting top shelp, which makes buying tall things really easy.\n\nThey have one of the nicest selections of glazed pots around. I'm already finding this to be a little bit of a problem, since I have now decided that I need to change out all of mine because the ones I bought are so darn pretty and colorful.\n\nParking can be a little iffy, when crowds overflow from the neighboring businesses. I was intrigued at how a nursery could set up a workable space at the end of a strip mall, but they did a nice job.\n\nThis has replaced the big box shops for when I need something quick and I have a feeling that they will be seeing a lot more of me in the spring."
One,"""Dear Plesant Nails,\n\nI have been to the nail chop chop that is Nail Too and I just want to say... I'm sorry for all sh*t I've talked about you. I didn't know bad nails until I went to this place. I blame the chick at the bus stop whose fierce nails made me jealous. I went in search of the 'Island\ pedicure and gel back fills. That's it... pure and simple. and they STILL jacked it up!\n\nThe first guy was recommended to me and I insisted that I get gels, he got tired of me and dropped the drill and went back to a pedicure. Then an older lady wearing a jeweled encrusted tank top (i'm SO not lying!) and platform heels took a shot at it... and she kept nicking my nail bed. It was soooo painful! I couldn't believe it! That was SO my cue to leave... but before I was out the door, another lady with the most ornate nails EVER came and grabbed the drill and finished the job.\n\nshe was good, but I KNOW that was acrylic!! Plesant Nails had gel... actual gel on my talons... this place, had acrylic with an odd coating that was supposedly gel. I wasn't convinced. I liked the design. but I'm still frustrated. I chose not to get a pedicure as I just wanted to get out of there... the price was okay but my nails were in PAIN for days as the older lady really dug into my nail bed. \n\nI ended up popping them off and waiting several weeks before trying it again. At a different location. \n\nSo, although I won't give you another chance Plesant Nails, I just want to say that I'm sorry for allt he grief I caused you... I've been on the other side of the fence and apparently i was on the greener side all along! \n\nMy Best,\nCher T."""""""
Four,"I was lucky enough to have a work related seminar at this amazing hotel.  The place is beautiful. The staff is friendly.  Everyone employee I passed smiled and said hello.  If I had a question they were always very helpful.  \n\nSince I was at a seminar I did not get to enjoy the pool and other amenities, but would definitely come back another time on my own.  I did use the gym several times and it was very nice.  All of the cardio equipment have TV's. \n\nI was traveling solo and did not feel like the restaurants were conducive for solo dining; however, I did have room service several times and the food was always very good.  The market cafe is nice too.  It has sandwiches, wraps and salads that are good.  \n\nThey have a computer and printer near the front desk where you can check in for your flight and print your boarding pass for FREE.  Very nice.\n\nI subtracted 1 star because my room had no view at all.  In fact, I looked out at a wall.  It would have been nice when I checked in to have been told that my room looked out onto a wall."
Four,"""As crazy as I was about Tucson, I was rapidly let down by the next town I saw, the manicured Scottsdale, which, though the oldest town in the Old West or something, is the Scarsdale of Arizona.  So funny that the Yelp headquarters is in a place where dentists and their wives with straightened hair, Laura Mercier eyeshadow, dressed up in judicious straight legged jeans and expensive bomber jackets paint the town red by going out to restaurants with a glass of wine after.  Much as they got it poppin in West Hartford and Bronxville where I lived.  \n\nIts Old Town cedes any claim to baddest town in the West cred because it's a winking, hyper commercialized homage, replete with jewelry and souvenir stores.  However.  Its center is a manicured selection of huge, spacious restaurants, some aspiring to trendiness, some getting there (such as The Pink Pony, Bandera, and the Mission with its sprawling, romantic interior which we couldn't afford.)\n\nInstead, we headed over to the Daily Dose because of a recommendation that didn't come from Fodor's.  The Daily Dose is a spruced up trendy-ish bar restaurant slightly away on Scottsdale Rd from trendy restaurant row, with spruced up, good, solid bar lunch and dinner food.  Except the food happens to be very good and dependable.  \n\nThe mango mojito was somewhat girly and candied, but good with mango chunks bubbling up the wide bubble tea straw.  The calamari, sweet lord the calamari.  It is made from a softer, less chewy part of the calamari and paired with a mustard sauce.  Highly recommended to share!  I tried the rock shrimp taco on the waitress' recommendation which was a small mess of somewhat unfrozen shrimp, cabbage, and mayo, so less recommended.  However, the turkey burger she also recommended was very good!  Tender with cheese and a couple avocado pieces on top.  Guaranteed to devolve into a food coma after 30 minutes.  The second time we came, my family tried more good things, but I was less impressed with the dull carnitas with corn salsa and beans on the side.  As far as the service, both of the women who served us were accommodating and friendly, but with a slight edge of de facto faux Southern charm that I hear Phoenix and Scottsdale sometimes ally themselves with.  I thought that the service in Flagstaff and Tucson was more sincere, but I'm biased because I like them better.  Plus, I imagine that Scottsdale is one of those places like Dallas where women \put on their face\"""" for an hour just to go throw out the garbage.  And a woman who sometimes doesn't wash her face, like me, would be shunned."""""""
One,"I was at first impressed when we stopped in for a round of drinks on my birthday. Very swanky modern place with a fun and eclectic atmosphere and a great variety of drinks. \n\nOur group had a $60 tab, which we paid, then moved on to another place. The next day I found out that our $60 tab got charged, as well as a second charge for $219! I called my bank and disputed the charges (which could take 10 days) and they recommended working with management at Hanny's to cancel the charges, so the funds could be returned within the hour. I found out that our server accidentally charged our card for the wrong tab, voided the transaction, and then said nothing to us (probably hoping the money would be returned to our account before we noticed). \n\nWhen I called, the manager seemed nonchalant about the whole thing, never once apologized for what happened, and then said I shouldn't worry about it because they didn't actually charge my card and it would probably drop off on its own faster than he could contact his merchant services about it the following day. I still asked him to follow up, told him I'd appreciate his time, and reminded him we were talking about $220 here. He begrudgingly said he would and then didn't get back to me today. When I called, he obviously hadn't passed along the information to the other manager because he had zero knowledge of what had happened and the funds are still on hold 3 days later. \n\nHappy birthday, right?! Hands down, a very frustrating experience and I'm not impressed with their customer service AT ALL. For the lack of concern their management and staff have for their patrons, I'd rather spend my money elsewhere."
Five,"This store is so cute. Always so organized & neat, and very reasonable prices. All of my garments from here have lasted for months through multiple wears, washings, & dry cleanings (which you can not always count on these days unless you pay high $) The woman who works mostly M-F during the day, I can't remember her name :( is so nice and helpful. Always informative regarding sales, etc. and I never feel pressured to buy things or spend $ I don't want to. Definitely check it out for cute, cheap (around $50 & below) dresses and darling accessories!"
One,"I came here for a pre dinner drink before going to FnB.  My date and I went in and went straight to the bar.  I'm not going to bitch because I wasn't greeted by anyone, I could care less.  We sat at the bar, and sat, and sat.  Numerous servers walked by with no type of acknowledgment or to even maybe get the bartender.\n\n   The bartender finally came and showed no interest in serving us.  After enjoying our drinks I asked to close out my tab.  That took 20 minutes.  It was only my company and myself and two other patrons at the bar.  I gave my card as soon as he brought the check.  It actually took so long that I left my friend at the bar to sign my name so I could run down and go to FnB so they didn't think I was bailing on my reservation.\n\n   Now I'm not being overly sensitive, I'm just pointing out that this was piss poor service and exactly opposite of how the hospitality business should be run.  Based on my experience on just trying to get a drink, I have no desire to actually come here and try the food."
Two,"Not worth it. \n\nOut waitress was horrible. She forgot to bring our salad and every time we wanted refills she was no where to be found. \n\nThe chief was good and the food was good, but was small portions compared to most Japanese steak houses I have been to. Thought it was pricey too compared to similar places. What's up with having to pay extra for the fried rice, that's BS, every other place I have been that's included in the meal. \n\nGo some where else."
Four,"Long ago, there was a little girl who'd go out with her family to a long gone restaurant called Pink Pepper Thai Cuisine.  She'd eagerly await her thai iced tea (her favorite uncle used to call her the Nestle Quik Bunny because she would sip down her thai iced tea with wild abandon just like the Quik Bunny would sip down his chocolate milk) and it would be gone before the meal hit the table.  She'd then tuck into her favorite Pink Pepper dishes (mee krob, pad thai, cream chicken, satay etc) and it was heavenly.\n\nThe little girl grew up and moved away from Phoenix for many years.  Upon her recent return, she noticed that Pink Pepper had gone out of business and Tara Thai had taken it's place.  She whipped out her smartphone and checked Yelp to get the scoop on Tara Thai.  Turns out that the employees and yummy recipes were still there even though the name had changed.\n\nShe decided to hop on in to try the lunch buffet.  It was early in the lunch hour and everything was fresh out on the buffet.  After some pleasurable nomming on cream chicken, mee krob, vegetable spring rolls and other assorted delights from her childhood, one of the servers recognized her as the little girl who used to come in with her family all of the time.  Her heart swelled. She remembered happy times as a child and remembered her uncle calling her the Quik Bunny as she drank her thai iced tea. \n\nShe thanked the server.  Gave a little wink to the restaurant gods for the happy memories and knew she'd be back again soon for unrivaled Thai food....and she dined happily ever after."
Three,"""I like a good dive bar. A place where you can sit, get a drink for cheap enough and not be bothered. So, when Nathan S. and AMber W. brought me here, I thought it was cool. While I'm not likely to rush into any mosh pits, I can get into a little punk music given the right environment and Rogue West is the right environment. \n\nWe took our seats and the bartender came for a drink order. He started by asking to see my ID. I thought: Hell yes, I'm gonna love this place. Until, the \punk\"""" said, \""""Wow! You're older than I am.\"""" \n\nSo, for that... you lose one star."""""""
One,"""Embarrasingly bad Beef Bourguignon! \n\nI just had dinner there and felt inspired to write a review (warning?!) for others.  I steer clear of fresh fish and steaks at places like this, opting for the safer dishes that you shouldn't be able to mess up.  But did they mess it up! \n\nMy 'Bourguignon' was a giant single hunk of beef (like a pot roast) with a bit of sauce poured over it.  There were a miniscule number of mushrooms in the sauce, and the onions - red sliced onions - were raw and bitter (as in a salad).  The carrots were served on the side along with brocolli, like a steamed vegetable accompaniment. Now, a bourguignon should have cubed beef, and the onions, carrots, and such should be cooked in the broth for over an hour, infusing them with the flavors of the sauce. \n\nThey do have a 'pot roast' on the menu - \Slowly braised chuck roast with mashed potatoes and fresh vegetables\"""" - I think that's what they served me. This is the description for their bourguignon: \""""Tender chuck roast simmered in a flavorful vegetable stew with mushrooms, carrots, red onions and seasonal vegetables. Served with mashed potoates\"""" - I wonder if the 'chef' knows the difference?!\n\nEdited to add: I also got off to a bad start here; our waiter started out with 'have you dined with us before?' - this has become a trigger to me and immediately puts me on the defensive (the first thing I want to hear is, 'can I start you out with a drink or appetizer?').  So if I say no, does that mean I'm going to have to listen to him rave on about how good their food is, and help me read their laminated, over-produced menu?  Or is he going to sell me on their 'signature desserts', or their 'buy 5 get one free' program?  If I say yes, is he going to ask me what my favorite is ... It seems such a pointless question ... (like the current fad of \""""did you find everything OK?\"""" at the grocery checkout ... what are they going to say if you are honest and couldn't find half the stuff you wanted ....?)"""""""
Five,"BEST. PHO. IN. THE. VALLEY.\n\nHIGH QUALITY PHO.\nHUGE PORTIONS.\nACTUAL VIETNAMESE FAMILY MAKING THE FOOD.\n\nThe aforementioned points are very important for me. As someone who ranks pho as probably one of my most favorite foods in the world, I take pho restaurant critiquing very seriously.\n\nBroth: 5 Stars\n- How do you tell if a pho restaurant is good from the get go? You order it. They bring it to your table. Get your spoon... and taste the broth. This is where the love and care shows, people! This place has some legit broth and it shows that they actually care for the food they are making.\n\nVegetables: 5 Stars\n - Some places have nasty wilted bean sprouts... but at this place the veggies are always fresh. Good assortment of what's available: basil, bean sprouts, lime, jalapenos and some sort of cabbage-like leaf that has a great peppery taste.\n\nSpring Rolls: 5 Stars\n- A lot of places has this pre-made, but this place makes it to order. You can tell because when you bite into it, you can tell the pork was just recently grilled.\n\nThe only tough this is they may forget to fill up your water cup just because it's so busy.\n\nAs a Seattle native who's in the area for school, I had gone to many other places only to be incredibly disappointed. Back in my hood, pho places are just as numerous as Starbuck's and a good place is hard to find. Coming into this restaurant reminds me of going to some of my favorite places back home... I'll always be a Khai Hoan-er for Life!"
Three,"This place is huge. It's very clean and it's very pricey! I think it's fantastic for prepared food, or to pick up a quick dinner, but I would never do my everyday grocery shopping here. I think it's great for people on a gluten free, or  some type of restrictive diet, b/c there is a lot of variety for those with dietary issues. BUT, just b/c the stuff is made with 'healthy' ingredients, doesn't mean it's low calorie or low fat. The nutrition facts say it all if you bother to read them. I think too many people think b/c it's 'Whole Foods' that everything is healthy...um, not really!"
Five,"""This restaurant has a wide variety of foods from burgers to cheese steaks and much more. Really good food with wonderful views above the lake .

Four,"My husband and I lived here from 2009-2010 so this may be a little dated. However, I can say with confidence that during this time period,  this was a very nice apartment complex and we enjoyed living here.\n\nRent was very reasonable for such a nice area (hop, skip and a jump from Ocotillo.) Our apartment itself was lovely with upgraded appliances and a great kitchen. The two bedroom we were in was spacious, had great natural lighting and was overall very nice. I wasn't a huge fan of their parking policy. We had one covered space and the other was a first come first serve. We didn't take advantage of the amenities as often as we should have but when we did they were a reminder of the spoils of apartment living. San Palacio has a great pool with cabanas and tons of space in the immediate area. I enjoyed our time at this apartment complex and would recommend it to anyone looking for an apartment in Chandler."
Four,"Gold Bar is not hip, it is not polished, it is not new and it is not standard Phoenix/Tempe.  Gold Bar is easy to like and easy to sit in for a couple of hours grading papers.\n\nI come from cozy towns in Michigan, where when the snow falls heavy the streets grow quiet and everyone you meet has tinge of red to their cheeks and the need for a warm drink.  There's a kind of empathy that comes with this quaintness that is hard to find in Phoenix.  It was there in the old 3 Roots but you had to trade it for slow service. It's not there at Cartel, but that's not what Cartel is about.\n\nGold Bar is charming.  You're transported, as much as can be hoped for in our strip mall culture, to a cozy living room in another town when you spend a couple of hours here.  The family that runs it knows many of the customers names, they sell hearty foods and heavy drinks.\n\nJust from overhearing the son of the owners talk I can tell you: They have stamp cards. Monday is Pastry stamp Monday. Friday is Extra Shot Friday. Friday and Sunday nights are live Jazz. Sunday morning has classical guitar.  Saturday night is game night, where they have drawings every 20 minutes to give you free drinks, eats and prizes.\n\nSo, it is quiet and you can hear everybody else, the drinks are a bit expensive and the food is only okay.  All of those things add up to make this place a little slice of home for someone who is not the biggest fan of living in the city that ate the desert."
Four,"""K, so I'm totally mourning the official end of the Suns 2007-08 Season.  I wanted to rip off my O'Neal 32 shirt & sub-in for Nash, especially during the 4th last night---rrrrrrr!  My lovely San Antonio siblings are sending me a broom & Parker jersey as I write.  Anyway, I wanted to end it on a positive note, so I've decided to post about my Suns experience at the center....\n\nParking--You know, I never realized how much impact parking has on my overall experience until I started writing reviews...Anyway, parking for an event is a non-issue if you don't mind walking a few blocks to the center.  I parked off of 1st & Lincoln near an economically depressed area , with streets in serious need of repaving but @ the end of the night, my car was still there, unharmed.  Definite plus.\n\nSeating/visibility--We sat in the 'upper deck' but with the way the center is designed, I had decent visibility of the court, despite the dismal lighting.  I felt slightly dizzy seated so high, with the low lighting and constant action all around me...And IMO, I felt there was entirely too much seating allocated to \CASINO ARIZONA\"""". They pretty much take up an entire section.  I don't know who gets to sit there but it pissed me off.  \n\nEntertainment--I appreciated that they didn't do the random cam that identifies people on a jumbotron with the caption instructing people to '________'--you fill in the blank.  I've seen this @ hockey games, baseball, etc & always wondered how they avoided selecting two totally random people sitting next to each other to hug/kiss.  Or why the jumbotron always makes people actually get up and do the funky chicken dance.  Maybe it's magic....Anyway, I thought they did some cool stuff like give away a car, launch a jilion shirts into the crowd, and of course the gorilla was on hand to impress us with his slam dunking skills.  He was of course, aided by a trampoline, but who cares?  It's a slam dunking gorilla.  At the end of the night, the Suns beat the Blazers, so it was alllllllll goooooood!

Five,"Sens=delicious.  Not to be rude, but if your idea of fine dining is cracker barrel, this is not the place for you.  If however, you enjoy innovative, fresh, and perfectly portioned tapas-style meals then this could be your new favorite spot.  The fried tofu is especially out of this world delicious, and perfect!  Not soggy, and not cornmealy or battery...if you've ever tried to make fried tofu, or you've ordered it at other places, you know what I mean.  Hot and sour soup is also excellent and a refreshing change of pace from the brown sludge you'll find on the menu at other places.  Prices are very reasonable, and you'll likely have the pleasure of seeing Johnny as he grabs waters, brings out food, and otherwise performs quality  control.  Excellent service as well.  On a side note, it is a tad loud, and the seating is usually close to other people, but these are details I'm willing to deal with.  Try it out-you won't be disappointed!"
Four,"The place is cool, the food is good, and the girls are pretty, but my only draw back is there is only one poorly lit pool table!!!!\n\nOne thing I have to say is it feels like a strip club, but without the nudity.  The girls are very nice and talk with you until you get the food, then they kind of hang out at the next table until they order, neglecting the previous table.  Sometimes it takes a while to get refills or whatever else you want after your meal has arrived."

Four,"Yummy!  You will walk out of this place with a giant full belly, lol! We ordered the egg rolls and spicy chicken wings for starters. The egg rolls were really good and came with fresh and crispy romaine lettuce and dipping sauce. The spicy chicken wings were crispy and had a sweet and spicy taste- they were ok.  I then ordered the Bon Bo Hue to try something different and it was delicious! It came out with a nice plate of fresh bean sprouts, jalapeno slices, basil leaves, limes, and banana blossoms. The broth was so tasty and spicy. My hubby ordered some Pho and got a large and could not finish it because of the size--but he loved it. The atmosphere is really contemporary and clean--not what you usually see with Pho restaurants."
Four,"This review is only for Smoothie King; I've had a sandwich from Port of Subs once or twice but I've had Smoothie King numerous times...\n\nI think they might be a little bit more expensive than Jamba or Robeks depending on what you order... I sometimes spend upwards of $5 which is kind of expensive for a smoothie, but I go back because I really enjoy it.  This location doesn't seem the cleanest, but my favorite thing to order is the lemon high protein smoothie - it's always the perfect refreshing snack when I need something to hold me over for a few hours... i love the tart lemon flavor and i don't feel guilty drinking it either!\n\nDepending on your nutritional needs and flavor preference, you can find a smoothie for you... the franchise has existed since the 1980's, so obviously they are doing something right."
Two,"Coffee Plantation is a mix of serious minuses and a few distinct pluses.  First and foremost: the coffee here SUCKS.  I was drinking it for a while to chase away a lingering hangover and once the veil of alcohol residue cleared, I realized just how awful what I was drinking tasted.  It might have actually made the hangover taste in my mouth worse!\n\nSo I got a water to rinse out my mouth and decided I should probably eat too.  So I order a cheese and egg panini.  I swear, it looked like it was squashed in a George Foreman grill and put on a dirty plate.\n\nThe pluses of the place?  Well, it's just a pretty good study location.  They have a patio if you want to study outside. They also have a nice counter to study on if you want to face the wall and avoid distractions.\n\nA mixed bag to be sure.  Not a bad option for a change of pace, but unlikely to supplant any of my preferred study haunts."
Five,"Quality food and good service!\n\nMy favorite is Sauce's sausage and pepperoni pizza, with red peppers, onions and mushroom.  Definitely a gourmet pizza with quality ingredients.  Although it's a small 12 inch thin crust pizza, it is satisfying and has a freshness unlike the typical heavy pizza you find at other chains.\n\nThe vegetable chopped salad is served in a generous-sized bowl.  I like the light dressing and crisp bite size veggies.\n\nYou order at the counter and your meal is brought to your table.  The servers are attentive and check to see if you need anything. This service always earns them a tip by my appreciative lunch buddy.\n\nI look forward to a future lunch at Sauce!"
Five,"""I don't even know how many times I've been to Nami since it opened. It really doesn't matter that it's 30 minutes away from my house... I make up reasons to go weekly.\n\nAn update on the \Here's what we ordered\"""" section:\n1. Cinnamon roll -\nA classic. They heat it up for you so that it's too warm and fragrant and irresistible not to finish. It's perfect. I hate it. I hate them. (That's a lie.)\n2. Chocolate cake doughnut - \nCall me a conspiracy theorist, but I'm pretty sure that this is just a ring-shaped piece of chocolate cake. That said, it's a very good piece of ring-shaped chocolate cake.\n3. Sugar cookie - \nI brought this home for my very non-vegan little sister, who tasted it immediately and said, \""""This (nom) is the best (nom) sugar cookie (nom) I've ever had in my life!\""""\n4. House made granola, yogurt & berry parfait - \nNami's granola is like cocaine. You will never be able to have enough of it. But that's okay, because on some mornings it just feels right. I do wish the yogurt wasn't soy-based and the berries weren't frozen, but honestly, it still rocks.\n5. Vegan Victory Bar - \nIf you're looking for something more wholesome, this peanut butter-chocolate-spirulina (hence the green color)-nut-seed bar will satisfy your sweet tooth without making you feel gypped for picking the 'healthier' option.\n6. Hazelnut milk latte - \nAny of the lattes from Nami are fantastic. Choose coconut, almond, soy, hazelnut, or rice milk for a strong, nutty cup of awesome (and you can sweeten it with Stevia!)\n7. The MASH - If you're feeling daring, this is a fun way to spin the wheel of dessert fortune. I've ended up with a carrot cake tsoynami and a mint chocolate chip one. Both were delicious, but nothing beats the Monsoon.\n8. Brownie -\nLiterally the best brownie I've ever had. So chewy-rich-intensely-chocolate-y. It didn't even taste like there was flour in it. I want a hundred of them. Right now.\n9. Peanut butter bar - Don't be intimidated by this dense looking log. It's actually a light, crunchy, nougat-y bar with a thin layer of chocolate on top, although it does resemble peanut butter fudge.\n\nThe thing is... I've never had brunch here, which means I should probably head back on Sunday to get a feel for it. Now there's an idea."""""""
Four,"First of all  BIG THANKS to Alex our waiter. Saddled with the party of women celebrating, he never was rude or impatient but handled us like a pro at customer service!  He made the evening click with smoothly timed drinks and ordering. \n\nBrought some of my friends to TICOZ  for a go away party for a friend  getting married. So glad we came here..the ambiance was festive yet upscale.  We loved the food , music , guacahummus and the the nice big table which we hogged all evening. \n\nThe gals loved the guacahummus , salsa and chips , a great start with drinks , we had wonderful entrees  like the special of chicken pasta and my delicious blue corn enchiladas which I would gladly have again. \n\nNice touch with the complimentary  Churro with ice cream and raspberry sauce. I will be back!"
Four,"I've got to give mad props to any business that really checks up on it's Yelp reviews!  While I gave Wildflower a positive four star review, I did point out a few things about the location and restaurant that I did not like.  Wildflower's founder, Louis, contacted me to tell me that he agrees with my assessment of the parking situation outside the restaurant, and to show me where customers could find nutritional information and ways to order their meals to fit their dietary needs.\n\nWhile stopping in for a soup and half sandwich order for lunch, I decided to try a baked good on this visit.  It was just a chocolate chip cookie, nothing crazy, but I've got to say it was a very tasty cookie.  Perhaps a scone or muffin will be in order next time I drive by."
Five,"The Paper Studio is a store, a gallery, and a classroom. They carry lots of craft, bookbinding, and scrapbooking supplies, as well as stationary and some amazingly beautiful paper. They have a small gallery where they show handmade books and other paper crafts by local & national artists. They also hold a regular schedule of classes: bookbinding, paper making, letterpress classes and more. Check out their website for a schedule. The staff is super friendly and nice, the classes are fun, and it's always a pleasure to shop there."
Five,I stopped in for a quick iced peppermint mocha and was very impressed all around. The staff was extremely friendly and excited to chat about the business. This place is not your typical coffee shop. They have tons of space to meet up and relax. They are also an art gallery with some beautiful pieces to look at. Culture is a good way to describe this business because they are really bringing a unique culture and vibe to the downtown Phoenix area. I always excited to discover places like this and support them with my business. I encourage everyone to check this place out and keep it alive!!
One,"Despite delicious food and an impressive wine list, it hurts my heart to say that this place isn't worth the trouble. The staff is pretentious and unaccommodating. I have been here a handful of times and every server I have had has an excuse of why they cannot meet my requests. I understand a policy of not splitting checks, but then please let us know that when you are taking our order. One of the servers also told me that they cannot seat parties of five without a reservation. I understand having to wait for a table, but the place was just opening and nearly empty at the time. The menu also gives very vague descriptions making it nearly impossible for anyone with specific food allergies. I love my wine, but I am pretty comfortable with the fact that I will never go to this place again."
Five,"Excellent service + excellent food + excellent ambiance = highly recommended. I dined at Lon's based on the recommendation of the concierge at the Arizona Biltmore. We had a party of 8 and despite being close to closing time Lon's graciously accepted our reservation and opened a private room for us. The volume was perfect for a conversation and the private room was sized perfectly. Ordering went flawlessly and the server was knowledgable and easily made recommendations for us. The timing of the appetizers, main course and dessert was also flawless. The food itself was excellent, everyone enjoyed their meal. After dinner and despite the fact that we were the only people left in the restaurant we were treated to a private tour of the restaurant which was previously the home of an artist. The staff was phenomenal. All in all this was a wonderful dining experience and I highly recommend it."
Three,"I don't know how many Margaritas some of these reviewers HAD becuase these people were ANYTHING but fast!!\n\nThe dining room wasn't even full and there were 3 servers and yet it took them nearly 30 minutes to take our drink order! I wanted to leave, but my friend wanted to eat there soooo bad so I decided to give it a try. After our food was ordered, it took ANOTHER 30 minutes for the food to hit the table... Our server then brought a round of refils and the check and we didn't see her for the rest of the night! \n\nI did enjoy my dinner, the food was better than good. I had menudo, which wasn't anything great. I've had much better menudo on the rez! OH! and they didn't have any cilantro!! I was shocked! so my menudo lacked soul. :( I got a side order of beef  taco which was good. :) I liked it. \n\nThe salsa is KILLER!! I kept trying to eat it so I'd get used to it... no such luck! But it definatly released the endorphans! And cleared my sinuses... and brought a little water to my eyes! And that says a lot, cuz I can handle a lot of hot food!\n\nOver all, I dig the food, the place was very colorful and festive. Which is always a plus. I could do without the mariachi band. oh DUDE! the band almost got into a fight with one of the patrons!! The patron was all drunk and kept requesting songs, and I guess he didn't know it was $3 a song, so they wanted their money, he didn't have any and that's when things got U-G-L-Y!! It was funny cuz the guy was drunk but yeah - it's $3 a song! But yeah, I dig that rough environment. \n\nI honestly think it was an isolated incident, overall it was a nice place. I recommend sitting by the window and just enjoy your self while trying to handle the salsa!!"
Four,"""Convenient and tasty. I work right next door to this place, and it's like my office's cafeteria. \n\nThe best thing about this restaurant are the wonderful people who run it. They're always very friendly and helpful. \n\nThey feature a surprisingly diverse menu that ranges from the obvious (gyros and pitas) to the not-so-\Athenian\"""" (egg salad sandwhiches and ruebens). \n\nOne thing I really like about this restaurant is how generous they are with their high-quality indgredients. You can really tell they don't cut many corners.\n\nIt should also be mentioned that they have the best Greek salad in town. It's delicious! (just get it without the onions, thy're way too strong)"""""""
Five,"This place is definitely worth the long trek out to Gilbert.  It's some sort of retro farm house planted in the midst of beautiful scenery... you won't miss it.\n\nAhi Tuna Burger is heavenly.  Juicy seared Ahi tuna served on a bun w/ crunchy cabbage mix and a side of wasabi mayo?  Count me in.  Serious.  I always get the sweet potato fries because they are some sort of perfection.  This place serves the freshest food I have ever seen.  I guess the farm part helps?\n\nI would count this place down because there are usually so many loose children conquering the beautiful grounds while parents mindlessly chat amongst themselves but... I'm not that heartless.  It's usually always clean, the misters keep you cool & the heaters keep you warm.  This place is good for everyone... just beware of Chandler/Gilbert moms & dads who think farm grill is code for playground."
Two,"Just left here not fifteen minutes ago.\n\nOne table of ladies with one rude woman sat next to us. Not the restaurants fault, yet irritating that such people exist.\n\nLemonade to drink, just fine as is.\n\nBrie Brulee 12\n\nQuite uninspired in presentation and the brie was very ordinary, my friends Mer and Mike serve one of much higher quality.\n\nFrench Dip Sandwich 12\n\nThis one was with salad. Another lackluster presentation, but that would have been ok if were good. It was not, or at least to me. \nThe beef was cut too thick and with it being too well done and the gristle made for a tough sandwich with little redeeming flavour.\nIt was left half eaten\n\nChicken Cordon Blue 10\n\nI did not eat this, but Brice told me it was ok if all you were expecting is a chicken and ham sandwich. He did finish.\n\nWe had mentioned we wanted to talk with someone about renting the extra room, or get a card. The wait person said ok after we are done she will send someone out.\nWe did sit a while after we were done; no one came out or was a card offered. But it might have been because I guess I caught her off guard earlier.  \nIn the middle of eating our sandwiches she asked if everything tasted good. I said no, she looked at me as if she did not understand, so I repeated that I did not like my food. Talk about someone's face changing from a smile to a deer caught in the headlights, she stammered and said sorry then ran off. NO question of why I felt displeasure or any thought of remedy. It did give us a chuckle with such lack of attention. But what it also did was make us reconsider if we should even think about the room for a party.\n\nSo once again I am in the minority since no rave from me.\n\nOh yeah and we had to ask for forks. Hahhahhahhah oh well......."

Four,"When Taj Mahal closed/was sold my boyfriend and I were sorely disappointed that we lost our favorite Indian restaurant and lunch buffet. By chance we went here tonight and finally after a couple of months we can say we've found a new favorite! We are snobs when it comes to good Indian food and we were giving up on finding another good place to go to.\n\nI am a korma girl and it was so tasty, their mild is pretty mild so if you can handle some spice go to medium, and my boyfriend's masala was surprisingly better then Taj Mahal's. A feat we though was impossible. The garlic naan was cooked/baked to perfection--- at other places we've tried its been burned or awkwardly gummy.\n\nEven though we just had dinner there tonight we decided we're going back tomorrow for lunch to check out the $8.95 lunch buffet!"
One,"""15 minutes after my wait in the drive thru of \cash only\"""" I couldn't help but think about the negative impact this business has on the environment. I see several cars ahead of me receiving several bags of food. It starts to make sense \""""why the wait\""""; large orders. Finally my turn! I think to myself; \""""this should be quick, my order is small\""""... 6 more minutes later I finally get my change and food. What I learned about my stay at the window... One person's job is to check to see how many cars are coming while the other two prepare food, with no sense of urgency, I've seen molasses move faster. Upon arriving home I see my hot food is sitting in styrofoam. Nice Pete! My mushrooms are just water battered in salt and there is an excessive amount of \""""chips\"""". I generally don't like wasting food, but, as I am not a pig and all I wanted we're fish and \""""mushrooms\"""" I did throw some away. I don't imagine this food ages well.

Five,"I made an appointment for 11:00 this morning, and was back on the road by 11:40!  Their service is fantastic, and they even put my seat back in just the right position (I'm pretty short).\n\nI have to say Cody really made my day.  I was going to get the second-cheapest tires for my car because I'm on a very tight budget, but he pointed out that there were other tires better suited for my car with a much higher rating; the only problem was that they were about $50 more than what I could spend.  I expressed this concern, and he made me a deal to fit the better tires into my price range.  He was not aggressive, but instead helpful, polite, and understanding, and I am very grateful for that.  I would go back there in a heartbeat."
Four,"So I went here last night with the BF after getting our 24 hour coffee at Xtreme Bean. I had heard all of the rave reviews of this place, and decided we must try it while we were just passing by. We went through the drive through at around 11:30pm and the man who was at the window was very friendly. We got a chocolate devil's food and a strawberry. They came out hot.... Whoa. Hot donuts at 11:30pm?!?!?! blew my mind. I don't think I have ever had hot donuts in the middle of the night. Both of the donuts were good... warm, crunchy in parts, melty in parts. yum. This place has not jumped on the weird flavor bandwagon of several donut shops I have been to (eg voodoo donuts in portland, Donut Man in Glendora, CA), so you can't get a bacon maple bar or a fruit loop donut, or a fresh sliced strawberry donut, or anything like that, but that's ok, this is not that kind of place.  I may not be a great judge of donuts, as generally donuts is one of my least favorite desserts, but these were some very good ones. I would definitely recommend them(and they were way better than Donut Man... so take that food network!)!"
Four,"Not too shabby. Decent drinks, cheese/meat plate was standard but good. The beet salad didn't have many beets on it.. more lettuce. I think we were wanting it to be all beets. The highlight of the whole dinner was the squishy bread that came with the cheese plate. Pizza was also good. Big negative was that all 4 pizzas were soggy in the center. Other than that, no complaints. The one with fruit on it was the best. The sausage was typical, but good, the margarita didn't seem to be a winner with the table, I thought it was good. I like that rubbery cheese thing though.. The one with seafood on it was my least favorite.The tiramisu with pine nut brittle was tasty, the chocolate cake was fine."
Five,Delux is great - lots of good beers on tap.  also a bunch of vegetarian options - grilled cheese is great as is the caprese sandwich.  we usually sit at the bar which is good.  they have a great patio even though it overlooks a parking lot.  inside seating is not for me - it's like long picnic benches where if its crowded you are right next to strangers.   something i hate.  great atmosphere and a smallish tv which usually has sports on it.
Two,"""I made it to Guiseppe's only after a friend had seen it on the Food Network.  I'd heard of it before, but hadn't ever felt like making the trek out here from Glendale.  On one hand, I'm glad I did.  I've been lucky finding good Italian food places as of late.  It's also nice to know what people are fussing over with places like this, that get noticed after being on tv.  On the other hand, the overall experience I just found lacking.\n\n\nYes, I know it was on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives.  Even though I suspect it falls into the first category, I still think it could have been better.\n\nThere was a wait.  Which only shocked me since it was an off night, so be aware of that.  Reading many of the previous reviews, I had caught that it was BYOB.  So we had run over to the Sprouts next door and grabbed a few bottles.  Surprise!  No more BYOB.  Oh well, wine never really goes to waste.\n\nThe place was cramped, and my party of 5 was squashed into a tiny corner table.  Then, what made that even more exciting, was the roving guitar player that started as we sat down.  As far as ambiance goes, he and his female vocal accompaniment left a bit to be desired.\n\nThe food was good.  If I were to rate solely on that, it's deserving of 3 stars easily.  The eggplant appetizer was thin sliced and breaded, though I would have liked more of the red sauce on it to combat the dryness of the breading.  I can't comment too well on the bruschetta appetizer, as splitting 4 different types 5 ways doesn't allow for a sizable tasting.  The bolognese I had was very tasty, and the inclusion of ox tail to it was a very very good one.\n\nBut in the end, the pretty good food couldn't save me from an overall \meh\"""" dining experience."""""""
Five,"This is a slice of France in the desert, mes amis. OK, that sounds weird, but it's true.\n\nThe owners studied cooking in Lyon, which is to French cuisine what San Francisco is to baseball (sorry, still giddy about that World Series win). Anyway, they know their stuff.\n\nOur group ran through several crepe dishes, two different quiches, croissants and palmiers. The baked goods were terrific and the crepe-eaters were smiling too.\n\nThe place felt a little like some of the unpretentious places we've dropped anchor while in France. Might have been the French movie playing on the TV (Le Gendarme de Saint-Tropez), could have been the pastis bottles behind the bar, or maybe it was the Olympique Lyonnaise soccer banner on the wall.\n\nIf you speak any French at all, try it out on Pierre or Catherine (the owners).

Four,"I really love when I go to a restaurant and I am able to get a unique flavor that I can't find anywhere else. This love of mine gets harder and harder as I try more Mexican restaurants here in Phoenix. Los Taquitos reassures me that these places still exist though, and they do it with the Bombero. The Bombero's sauce is an enchilada-style kind of sauce with the twist of ketchup tang. It threw me off a little at first because I didn't know exactly what to expect, but as I munched on each bite, and the spiciness of the sauce began to take over, I knew that my taste buds had made a new friend. The al pastor and the chips were also very tasty, but I don't think many people will be blown away with those items like I was with the Bombero. \n\nI also want to add that the staff was extremely friendly during my visit. The cashier walked me through what I should try (recommending the Bombero if I was a fan of heat) and she didn't once seem impatient. That's always a huge plus to me. \n\nI'll definitely be back soon! I already find myself craving that Bombero sauce. You should definitely check Los Taquitos out if you're in the neighborhood. It's solid Mexican food at decent prices. If they add a happy hour, this will definitely be a busy spot! Next up for me, the original location!"
Four,"Stopped in with my husband for a quick bite right before lunch.   We had heard about this place being good, so we were exited that we just happened to be near it that day.  I had other lunch plans so opted to just share with my husband.  He ordered the chicken and waffles wih grits and eggs.  He knows how much I love grits so he gave those to me.  I hate to sound full of myself, BUT I make delicious grits!  So I can't say I was too crazy about these.  They really didn't have any flavor to them.  They did have lots of butter though.  Now, the chicken on the other hand was perfect.  Perfectly seasoned, perfectly cooked, just perfect!The waffles were really good too!  My husband really enjoyed his egss.  I didn't try those, though.  I will go back to try some of their other menu items."
Four,"I don't care what anyone says, I love Filiberto's.  Carne asada burrito, Arizona burrito, green chile, carnitas, machaca, chorizo, carne asada fries.... I love it all.  I'm not crazy about the cheese they use, so I usually order without it, or end up scraping it off. It's not gross, they just tend to be heavy handed.\n\nNothing beats a late-night Filiberto's stop, or a morning-after hangover buster.  And, their horchata is my favorite! If they delivered, my life would be complete."
Four,"""\cheap, yummy, creative menu!\"""" - 3.5/5\n\nWe stopped at the Hot Dog Stop yesterday to grab a quick bite for lunch. It was our first attempt at this restaurant. When we first walked in, I was pretty attracted by its decor with a wide array dressing condiments from ketchup to ranch dressing! We ordered a basic grilled hotdog for me and a Nogales burrito dog for J. I was pretty impressed by how cheap the whole set was! My grilled hotdog with fries and coleslaw only came at $2.65. Other than the Kyoto Restaurant in Old Town, I can't think any restaurant in Scottsdale that will give you such a cheap price for a set lunch. Haha. Good deal!\n\nJ's Nogales burrito dog was far way better than my basic grilled hot dog. Nogales burrito dog has 2 dogs, wrapped in a flour tortilla, pastrami, cheddar cheese, chili, onion and mustard! Amazing huh?! It was like a make over of hot dog in Mexican style. :) The set was $6.65. \n\nThe store is tucked away in Scottsdale Promenade.  We will definitely go back again for another type of dog!"""""""
Five,"Woohoo indeed.  I love visiting Phoenix and finding these cute little places that are in remade old houses.  TMI has a simple menu with excellent mac & cheese and good salads.  Their beer list is pretty good, with more than half of it being AZ brews, which I definitely enjoy trying.  Also, the prices on everything are fair, even cheap.  Even though the place is small, it was not totally packed when we were there and there is plenty of parking in their lot.  They have music playing late at nihgt, so it gives it more of a bar feel than a restaurant.  Yay for The Main Ingredient."
One,"""\Lowering Cane's expectations\"""" should be the name.\n\nThey have just set the bar low on food quality and taste.

Four,"ok, so really. how can you go wrong with burgers? i guess it's a just little absurd to me that people dress up to eat a burger. or that people choose to drink a glass of pricey wine instead of say, a root beer float with their burger. speaking of which, their rootbeer float is too pricey for what you get....\n\nat any rate, i took my brother to eat here once upon a time, for kicks and giggles. see what all the hype is about. we were actually seated really quickly on a busy night, and quickly ordered our burgers. they were good. that goes without saying. and i really enjoyed the decor and the fries in the mini shopping cart! yes, something so ridiculous it is adorable. i don't really like having to order fries separate, because i think they should just come with your burger, but i digress. the burgers were juicy, came out fast and piping hot, cooked to our specifications, and surprisingly, not too much more expensive than my childhood fave, red robbins. ok fine, at least their fries had yummalicious dipping sauces.\n\ni'd go again, just not on a busy night. and maybe i'd dress up a little more. but then i'd feel crazy - like, why am i wearing a dress to eat a burger? but i do like those fancy-schmancy burgers... i guess i can suck it up."
Four,"I have to say I think Zipp's has got it dialed in.  I have never made Zipp's a destination place but now with more of them through out the Valley I find that there is one in my daily path more often than ever.  I usually find myself at the Indian School one where the bartenders are always fantastic and they know what type of experience I need at the time.  I have never had a bad meal, with my favorite being the addictive Manaco Foccacia Sandwich.  Zipp's is emerging or has emerged as the most solid and consistent sports bar and grill in town."

Three,"The tortillas were great. It's hard to beat Carolina's, but Verde has the closest I've tasted thus far to doing just that. I got the oregano-lime chicken and got to try the green chile. Both were very good. The chicken reminded me of El Pollo Loco (that's not a bad thing). It was fresh and when combined with rice, beans, salsa and a tortilla, my taste buds were very pleased. The green chile was the real winner though. The pork was flaky, tender, and loaded with flavor. I would have preferred more heat in the chile, but it was tasty nonetheless.\n\nFrom what I keep reading, I need to try breakfast here. The next time I head to Verde it will probably be in the early morning for that."
Five,Short Review: \n\nWhisky:\n\nThey have a ton of whiskey's to chose from if whiskey is your thing we had the whiskey flights for beginners and I was happy overall with the quality and price in the flight.  The whisky's were very smooth.\n\nService:  Very good and knowledgeable of the menu\n\nAtmosphere: Pretty cool its kind of hard to explain but its more of a lounge then a typical sit down place.  They have a few different types of eating areas.  We ate at one that had low chairs and kind of a coffee table height table.  (hard to describe) .  \n\nFood:  I had the whisky king burger and my wife had the pulled sandwich.  We both shared some duck fat fries.  The duck fries were very good a little different then regular fries I found the insides sort of creamy.  The portion size is decent.  My wife's sandwich was awesome it had a nice smoke flavor to it that kind of reminded me of meat cooked over a camp fire.  \n\nNow to the Burger.  For 26 bucks this burger had better blow me away.  I can tell you with absolute honesty this is the BEST BURGER in ARIZONA hands down.  I love burgers and have tried them all over.  This one has made my top three list.  If is was not for the price it would be my number one.  But its worth it to treat yourself to this.  The burger was juicy and the topping succulent.  From the bacon to the blue cheese to the Foie Gras.  This burger will blow you away.  I made a video to show all of you how awesome it is http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtyvgotbtEM  .   If your in Scottsdale and you can afford a treat get one of these burgers.  If you are a burger foodie you have to try it.  Oh burger I can't wait for our next encounter!
Four,"""I've been to Stax a couple times, and after my review hiatus, I am happy to make this spot my \Comeback\""""! \n\nI popped in for lunch today with three former coworkers. It's been a bit rainy and cold, so grabbing a seat was a bit of a challenge. We snatched up the open seats at the bar, and had a delicious little lunch.\n\nMy meal consisted of a shared portion of tots (complete with dipping sauces: jalapeno, chipotle, fry, ranch, ketchup, and hot) and a couple of their sliders (venison and buffalo). \n\nOne thing to note, is on their exotic menu, they have rabbit. I really wanted to try this, but it was unavailable today. Next time! I'd also like to try their Mac n Cheese. Lot's of different options.\n\nSince I have become a healthier eater since moving to Scottsdale, I think that I would share the Mac and Cheese with a good person.\n\nWhile we were sitting at the bar, the manager (maybe the owner) made simple conversation with us. Gave us his opinion on some of the menu items, and was a nice guy. Didn't come off as a douche, or as a salesman. Came off as a friend at the bar. The way it should be.\n\nAll around, a great experience. Solid place for good food. \n\nAlso...check out the fantastic beer selection."""""""
Four,"What can I say that hasn't been said?  If you don't mind the continual crowds, the food they serve is predictably excellent.  The breakfast fare is exceptional and worth the (sometimes) lengthy wait, however, it would be nice to have a PA system because if you are anywhere but in the main grocery area you cannot hear them call your name.  So consequently your food may sit on the counter for a while getting cold unless you jump up and down from your seat every few minutes to check on it.  \nThe pizza is excellent, as are the salads.  They have a decent wine selection.  The parking is abysmal and even the valets cannot find a place to stash the cars.  Between the 3 LGO places adjacent to one another, there is about 4X more human capacity than vehicle accommodations.  That being said, don't even try to order take-out, you'll get frustrated trying to find a place to park while you run in to get your food."
One,"""The food was decent, however I am writing about their underhanded business practices.\nI ordered a travelzoo voucher for $69 that included 2 3 course meals. It said \Regularly $140\"""". What we ordered, if had been ordered off the regular menu would have been about $100. However, we were charged tax on the full $140. \n\nSecond, even though on the voucher it says \""""PLEASE TIP ON THE FULL VALUE OF THE CHECK.\"""" (which implies tip is not included and we get to choose the tip amount) and nowhere mentions automatic gratuity, 18% gratuity (18% of $140, even though we ordered $100 worth of food at the most) was automatically added to our check.\n\nThird, even if you had ordered the most expensive options, the highest possible amount it could be worth is $120, not $140. It is mathematically impossible to have the voucher be a $140 value, but that is what they add tax and tip to.\n\nFourth, after we told our waiter we were using a voucher, he seemed less interested in the service level of our table, which i later realized was because he had a guaranteed 18% (of $140) tip.\n\nI just noticed today they have another travelzoo deal \""""$79 - AWARD-WINNING FRENCH DINNER FOR 2 W/WINE, REG. $165\"""", I am posting this so hopefully if anyone is thinking of buying that voucher, they will read this first before they purchase it."""""""
Three,"I took the family here to meet up with some old college pals that I hadn't seen in some years on a recent weekend.  The visit started out strongly when we got a parking space right in front.  Score!  Timing was also good as our friends were just ahead of us in line.  We all ordered quickly and were able to find a table in the pizza area to accommodate the six of us. \n\n This would have been a great time for us to start reminiscing and catching up, right?  Right?  Uh, except that there is no microphone/announcing system to tell you when your food is ready.  In the words of the cashier when I asked her if we would hear our names if we weren't next the food counter, 'it's not likely'.  So, unfortunately, half of us waited for the food, while the other half of us waited back at the table.  I'm certainly not asking for table service, but maybe a PA system so those eating next door or outside might be able to relax at their table before their food arrives.\n\nEventually, the food came out.  (Seemed like it took awhile, but I'm guessing that's partly because I was hovering around the counter).  It was...okay.  Nothing special about it, and my sandwich (turkey/cheese/avocado/etc.) did not do a very good job of staying together, it was sliding all over the place.  \n\nThe highlight of the visit was that I had a faux-celebrity sighting of someone who used to be on MTV.  When that is the highlight, you sure aren't getting more than three stars..."
Four,"""Sonic. Never had it until I went to AZ. \n\nSo..they have everything. Burgers, sandwiches, wraps, coneys (what?), salads, smoothies, breakfast items, a billion sides, desserts, and numerous beverage choices.\n\nEveryone raves about the tater tots, so I ordered them. Yeah, they were....tater tots....a lot of...tater tots. Don't get me wrong, they were good, but....they were tater tots.\n\nI think the Cherry Limeade is where it's at. I'm a sucker for the little marachino cherries in my beverages. Reminds me of \kiddie cocktails.\"""" The peach tea is also delicious, as is the slushes.\n\nThere's one thing I didn't understand about this place: They sell bags of ice through the drive-thru. Now, someone help me out....Is that standard for all Sonics? Or, is it because it's Arizona and it's 19,000 degrees? Just curious."""""""
Four,Cool Pacific Northwest brands available here that you can't find elsewhere in PX.  Many deals are fantastic (~1/2 the sale price other places) but the other items can be the same price or even more as other stores. The bulk section is nice and I appreciate the different sized bags. Went on a Sunday morning and didn't have any problems with crowds. The deli doesn't have cheese on display but they did say you could purchase cheese and they would slice it at the deli. It was nice and I was surprised they even do a reusable bag credit!
Five,"""Essence remains a wonderful bakery and wonderful spot for breakfasts, brunches and lunches. \n\nCatchphrase cliche but totally applicable, brief summary of Essence's essence: A gem of a place.\n\nBonus round: Their macroons are omfg! \n\nStatement from my review 2-years ago still stands:\n\This is how breadstuffs and cookies should taste; there's just a perfect balance of sweetness, creaminess, saltiness and flavor in eat morsel that gets placed out for sale at this bakery and it is such a refreshing, needed, and welcomed change from corporate bakeries which push hypersweet everythings on people these days.\"""""""""""
Four,"""I read that the guy who owns GoDaddy shot an elephant...at night...using spotlights...I'm thinking his fully tumescent \manhood\"""" must be the size and color of a 7 year old raisin...I can't imagine what he thought he was proving by felling one of these magnificent creatures with high powered/laser sighted rifle from 500 yards away, while it stood transfixed by the spotlights glare.\n\nThere was a word that we used for poachers that did the same thing while hunting deer, when I was a kid back in Oregon...\""""Asshole\"""".\n\nHe did prove to me that I will need to move any and all business I can away from GoDaddy...\""""vote with your feet\""""...but I guess that's another review.\n\nThe Beautiful Carin and I were in Scottsdale on business this past week and we take these opportunities to spend time with those near and dear to us!\n\nAt the very tippy top of the \""""near and dear\"""" list is our lovely daughter, Whitney.\n\nWhit is a Vegan...with a capital \""""Vege\""""...and she was distraught by the wanton slaughter of an African elephant by some dot bomb misogynist.\n\nSo she was thrilled that her meat lovin' daddy was going to take her to Green for dinner...an experience so very alien to me that I made Carin pick up a pound of fully cooked bacon and bring it to dinner in her purse for me...just in case!\n\nI am not a Vegan...I was born and raised on a cattle ranch...I do love a good medium rare rib-eye...I don't think it hurts Elsie the Cow to have a teat twiddled so I can have cream in  my coffee or cheese on my burger...and yet, the elephant deal brought a tear to my daughters eye and touched my black flinty excuse for a heart!\n\nI checked Yelp and saw that while my Vegan friends on yelp love this place, my decidedly carnivorous Yelpy friends were also nearly unanimous in their agreement that Green is foodgasm inducing!\n\nWe ordered way too much food...Chili Fries, Egg Rolls, a Green Burger, the Secret BBQ Chicken Sandwich, No Harm Chicken Parm...I barely had room to choke down a couple of Tsoynami's and an oatmeal cookie sandwich!\n\nEven after we were stuffed, Whitney took home enough leftovers for a week!\n\nThe big question about Green is \""""why didn't I ever eat here, when I lived here...Why?\""""\n\nI don't know...but I will be putting on my hemp cargo shorts, a tie dye t-shirt and growing a neck beard...and I will be eating here again.\n\nI like to \""""fit in\"""".\n\nThe menu is fairly extensive...the portions are plenty big...the flavors are bright and well defined and the textures and aroma's (always a big deal for me) are both exotic and welcoming.\n\nI didn't have to break out the bacon (although I should have taken my flask...no cocktails at Green for Donald...oh well, agave sugar cola was a delightful departure from the ordinary).\n\nI really could eat this way on a regular basis...it's that good...I probably won't, but it's nice to know I could!\n\nI imagine that Karma will have it's own way of dealing with a self-justifying, trigger happy technotard...for me, the occasional dinner at Green nicely balances the Karmic forces at work in my life...and tastes good, too!"""""""
Five,"Totties is just about one of the best restaurants  I have been to lately.  I am reasonably certain that all their food is good but I probably will never know as the only two items I get EVERY time I go are their spring rolls and their Beef Pho Tai soup!  It is that good!  The spring rolls have chunks of pork and fresh shrimp and are laced throughout with cilantro and rice.  They are amazing.  My boyfriend and I douse them thoroughly in their delicious peanut sauce that we doctor up with soy sauce, plum sance and a spicy red sauce.     Then we have the Pho Tai which seriously even  if I was a step away from death and sick with a cold I would still  drive to Totties to have instead of that crappy Campbells Chicken Noodle Soup.    The owner (Tottie- go figure!) told me that she makes the beef broth with beef marrow which sounds really gross until you have it.  There is an undescribable seasoning (marrow?) in the soup that is just delicious.   And that is another dish that you doctor right up- add a little bean sprouts, fresh mint, fresh cilantro, leetle bit of peanut sauce, soy sauce and you are done.  We practically want to scrape the bowl clean.  Being from Scottsdale and watching my girlish figure, it is pretty embarrassing that I am practically jabbing the boyfriend to get to the soup!\n\nSo that is it!  The new location is beautiful and I hope that they have great success there as it has more panache than their first location.  Yum!"
Four,"""I have never stayed at the Biltmore but I recently went here for a conference (1 day only) and I was blown away by how beautiful it was.  The grounds are meticulously kept a brilliant green and the gorgeous flower beds made my heart smile just walking around.  I loved the architecture of the buildings (even though I am not a FLW fan).  The stonework and also the outdoor statuary gave the place a very Native Latin American feeling without that cheesy \southwest\"""" decor.  Even the lobby was gorgeous... the restaurants and bar had such a classy feel to them.  I was surprised by how many pools this place has, each with a different vibe to it.  You could go to a different one every day depending on your mood.  Between those and the shops, restaurants, outdoor games, and golf courses it seems like this is truly a place you could just stay at without leaving for the entire trip.  I hope someday, I will. ;0)"""""""
Four,"I fell in love with Rice Paper the minute I walked in. It is a small historic house converted in to a quaint and hip dining area. There is a large patio in back that I am sure will be heavily used come cooler weather.\n\nOur servers name was Derek and he was funny, attentive and personable even though the place was packed. \n\nThe food was amazing, and to name a few favorites:\n\nFirecracker Shrimp - Lightly breaded and tossed in a spicy aioli sauce\nEnlighten Me Roll - Tofu, asparagus, jalapenos, jicama, crispy rolls, and sriracha served with peanut hoisin sauce\nShaking Beef - Holy deliciousness! Fillet mignon seared with soy, garlic, and onions served sizzling with steamed rice that was topped with mushrooms (see pics).\nCurry Tofu - Tofu, asparagus, shitake mushrooms, baby corn, and onions. We ordered it spicy and it was phenomenal.\n\nI also had the Ginger Fizz drink and it was pretty tasty. I can't wait to go back and try the pho!~"
Four,"To echo what a number of Yelpers have already said, the wings here are, in a word, LEGIT. Envision me as MC Hammer pantomiming the 2 Legit 2 Quit hand jive, except I'll add the final move of sucking wing sauce off my sticky mitt. After dining at ATL Wiings, you'll want to do the same.\n\nThe best thing about the wings here are that they are crispy and they are sauced right. I won't advise on what's the best flavor, because everyone has their preferences, but you can't go wrong by sampling a bunch of their 14 different wing flavors. You may even find a new favorite. I'm leaning towards the Citrus Chipotle and the Sweet 'n' Tangy, but then I haven't tried them all.\n\nA note about the Sweet 'n' Tangy wings. Not really sweet nor tangy... but delicious nonetheless. I would say that these are more salty and sweet, with a soy-sauce-forward note. I found myself strangely addicted to these and unable to quit stuffing them down my grateful gullet.\n\nI pray I will return to ATL Wings many times and try all their different styles of wings. But that's why we pray... we got to pray just to make it today. (Dear Lord, that's two MC Hammer references in the same Yelp review. I am no longer responsible for my own actions...)"

Three,"I've been to a few different Paradise Bakeries before and this one is no different. You can either call ahead or wait in line. Sometimes, waiting in line is worth it as there's this really sweet lady who walks around handing out fresh from the oven cookies. I normally order a sandwich (bacon turkey bravo) but their soups and salads are good too. I like their french onion soup the best and the roll that comes with it is a perfect accompaniment. The food is consistently good and the employees are generally friendly and accommodating. The one thing I don't like is the location. Sure, it's close to work and is perfect for lunch, but the parking is atrocious. It's difficult to get in, it's difficult to get out, and good luck finding a space! I'd recommend coming either before or after the lunch rush."
Four,"FOOD\n\nI had the won ton soup and crab puffs.  Hadn't had won ton soup in a long time but glad I did because it was excellent.  The crab puffs were good, but were a bit flat as if something had been set on top of them so the presentation could have been better.\n\nSERVICE\n\nThe service was perfectly adequate and the food arrived promptly.\n\nATMOSPHERE\n\nPretty standard Chinese restaurant surroundings. Wong's is not the coziest of restaurant environs but neither is it overly sterile."
Two,"After being a member of this gym for over ten years I just got fed up with the dirt, overflowing trashcans, filthy bathrooms, old, broken equipment, opening staff that show up late on weekends and a management staff that really doesn't care one bit about the members so I joined another gym.  Thus far I am very happy and glad to be done with LA Fitness.  I was very apprehensive about cancelling my membership after reading so many horror stories, but it went without a hitch.  The membership was cancelled immediately and they honored the last month that I had paid for when I signed up."
Four,"I had heard good reviews and decided to visit last night for dinner.  As other reviews have stated, the service is not super quick.  But it kind of worked with the island theme.  When the food was brought out, the proportions were generous (I had to get a to go box) but my friend ate all that was on his plate.  I had the 'sing a melody' and he had the oxtail.  \nI would recommend this place, but only if you have some time to spend (not on a rushed lunch break!)"

Two,"Blanco is not the place to find authentic Mexican food.  The atmosphere is really unique--super trendy and quite dim inside after sundown. The margarita was ok and the food was good, but nothing to write home about. They fill you up on chips and generic salsa to compensate for the smaller portions. \n\nI ordered the vegetable tacos with grilled chicken and black beans. The accompanying carrots and risotto-like rice were very out of place. \n\nThe service was impersonal and we hardly received any attention from our server--not even a single refill on water!  I'll go elsewhere next time I'm craving Mexican fare."
Five,"""we just returned from a 7 day stay at this location.  i had reserved a king accessible room because the extended stay rate was $69.00 per night.  when we checked in i asked how much extra the cost would be if we upgraded to a studio suite with a coach, mini refrigerator, microwave and small area with a sink.  the cost was $10 more each night!!! what a steal!.......\n\nthis location offers the great amenities that hampton inns are famous for.....hot breakfast..including waffle batter to make belgian waffles, fresh fruit, cereal, 2 hot items each day, instant oatmeal,danish, eng muffins,toast, bagels etc.  one morning we arrived at the end of the 6:00 am-10:00 am daily serving time and the fresh fruit was gone.  i asked the breakfast attendant about getting more??? she went in the back and came out with my own bowl of fruit! so much that i couldn't finish it all.....so i asked for some plastic wrap and brought it back to my room for later.  there is a small store which carries snacks, sundries and beverages. no charge to park your car....no daily resort fee, free wifi throughout the hotel.  comfy hampton beds.....with a nice card stating that comforters, covers and blankets are washed before each new guest stays in their room!!! that is a huge plus!  the 42\ tv was fantastic!! reason enough to want to stay here:):):) the lobby is bright and has coffee, tea, apples and a few bananas available 24/7.  if you miss breakfast or just want a snack on the go....there are bags at the front desk that have an apple, kelloggs special k bar, otis spunkmeyer muffin and a small box of mints!!!!  there is a 24 hour business center on site with 2 computers, 1 printer, and office supplies like paper clips, pens, hole punch.....you will need your room key to access the computer area as well as the hotel lobby after midnight i believe??\n\nthere is alot of different restaurants, fast food, banks, stores if you continue north on market st to the san tan village area........or if you turn left at market st and val vista dr and proceed south to east germann rd, turn right and travel approx 3-4 miles there is a huge shopping and dining complex called crossroads towne center.  this area also has a movie theater.\n\nalong with every good review..there is always something to be improved on......some hilton family hotels do not offer safes in their rooms and this location does not have an in room safe.  i wanted to bring my ipad with.  i feel better locking the ipad in a safe when i am out of my room.  i did find out that my trip insurance i purchased covered my ipad if it was lost or stolen so i brought it with.  an in room safe would be a good addition to rooms on a pay per use basis.  also, the juices at breakfast as not 100% juice...rather high fructose corn syrup based.  i have food sensitivities to hfcs so serving 100% juice would be a better choice and more healthy too.  \n\nthis hampton location is in a new area not recognized on a gps.  we had alot of trouble trying to remember we couldn't use the hotel address.  when i went to the computer room to use mapquest...2 times the printer was on \""""sleep\"""" and wouldn't reboot:(:(:(. the swimming area is very small.....\n\noverall a great stay for a great price staffed with great employees!!! a very clean hotel top to bottom!!!"""""""

Five,"I love olive oil. I would drink it if I wasn't worried about people judging me. And when I come here, I can drink it without strange stares! Outrageous Olive Oils and Vinegars I am convinced was created just for me and my love of all things olive oil. I have been in here twice now and I know that I will be back many times more. I found out about this place from groupon and also purchased a deal on living social. I have ended up with three bottles; basil oil, wild mushroom and sage oil, as well as the 18 year old balsamic.\n\nThe set up of this place is great. You walk in, and you are greeted by many hundreds of bottles of oils and vinegars and you can taste test to your hearts content. You pick up a little stack of cups and you can mix and match and taste till you find the olive oil and vinegar that was made for you. I could spend hours in here finding endless combinations of oil and vinegars, but then I would be broke because I would end up buying tons of bottles. If you don't have any idea what you are doing when you walk in here, the ladies who work here are more than willing to help you and suggest combinations as well as ideas of how to use all oils and vinegars. \n\nOlive oil is heart healthy, and what better place to make your heart happy than this!"
Four,"Best fresh baked pita bread ever!  If you're looking to have an amazing falafel pita, this is the place to get it.  You can grab a quick lunch here and eat at one of their little tables outside, or you can grab some food to go.  They have a great selection of olives, cheese, salads, falafel, baba ghanouj, hummus, stuffed grape leaves and much more.  \n\nIf you're looking to prepare a Middle Eastern recipe, you can probably get the majority of your ingredients here. They have tons of imported spices, and lots of cookbooks too if you need help deciding what you want to make. They also sell cool Middle Eastern mixed music tapes and CD's, as well as little knick knacks for your kitchen.  \n\nThe sandwiches aren't huge, but they're tasty and the prices are fairly reasonable for what you get.  Definitely give this place a try if you're in the mood for delicious, authentic Middle Eastern food."
Four,"I like Barro's Pizza.  They offer really fast service (take out) and good service in restaurant.  Their pizza is a good sturdy kind, lots of crust, plenty of sauce and fresh items.  Not 100% original, but if you like combination or pepperoni and sausage, they do a decent job of it.  Price wise, they are fair market.  You can download a reusable coupon from their website and get a large pizza (any kind of specialty) for $12.99.  This beats the competition, and frankly, is worth the inexpensive dining-in experience.  Good for families and large groups.  Call ahead and typically pick up your pizza on time -- two thumbs up!  Beware of Friday nights during Football season -- the line is very long, and often you have to wait to pick up your pizza.  Oh yes, good hot wings and cheesy bread."
Five,Not sure why I have not reviewed Manuel's. We have been eating with them for the past  maybe10 or more years. We eat there at least once or twice a month. Why do we keep returning?\n1. They are always very nice and make you feel they are glad you are there.\n2. The food is good and you always get more than you should eat at one sitting.( We always take food home with us. \n3. The food is priced reasonably. \n4. They are a neighbor hood family owned business and I always try to support this type of business. \n5. There is something on the menu for all tastes. (Some people that go with us like hamburgers.)\nWhen we go there is usually at least 6 people in our group. No one has ever complained about the quality of food. It has always been good. \nThey have always treat us as a valued customer. I often recommend Manuel's to other people.
Four,I don't ride the rail much other than for the fun of it. Been on a couple rail day rides just to check out the stops and see what I see. It was a bit crowded but we had a really great time.

All in all it was a really great experience. I look forward to my next adventure. :)

I also received high quality pre-natal care when I was pregnant with my daughter.  \n\nEveryone that I have dealt with has been very good but Venessa Thompson is the best!  She remembers me every time and truly seems to care about my concerns. \n\nI have recommended Boojum Obgyn to every woman I know and everyone that I have referred has given me similar feedback."
Three,"I've only been here twice and both times have had a good experience! The guy who we ordered food from was friendly, kind, and prompt. I think he could tell we were newbies, in fact, i'm sure he could tell. We ordered drinks, and then later ordered burgers and a side of onion rings to share. The onion rings were super delicious (i may be biased though because they are my favorite fried food!) and the Burgers were pretty darn good too for a dive bar. I think everyone should at least give them a chance if you like divey bars, good drinks, and yum-bar eats."
Two,"The BF and I went here this morning after thinking about trying this place for awhile. Let me start by saying that in order to look at their menu online you need to download adobe reader and even then, no prices are listed. That was my first semi complaint, but I figured it would be good, so I shouldn't worry too much about that. So we got there at around noon and the place is cute, big patio and all. We were seated and got water from the very nice bus boy who works there. Our waiter came by and we both ordered coffee, I got the fire island eggs and the BF got the biscuits and gravy. When we got our coffee we were assured that the food would be out shortly. Well...I don't know what shortly means to them, but we waited a good 20 minutes or so for our food. Not so awesome. The BF's coffee was empty for about 10 minutes of this time with no offer to refill and no one around to ask. We get our food and mine was alright...it's chicken in a cream cheese semi spicy sauce on 'pizza' bread (kind of thick...not really crusty, but whatever). The flavor was just very one dimensional and the dish got boring after the first few bites....it was kind of too rich, which isn't something I would generally say. The BF's biscuits and gravy were not good. He said they tasted like a pizza hut meat lover's pizza. The biscuits were not light or flaky and the gravy was just one note...spicy. Plus, the gravy tasted the same as the potatoes that came with it (kind of like peppers)....so it was a big plate of one flavor, and not even a very good flavor. Additionally, and not necessarily the restaurant's fault, there were tons of flies around....they kept landing on our cups and it was somewhat annoying...maybe the trash needs to be taken out more often? Or maybe it's because people had their dogs at this restaurant, which I think is somewhat gross...I don't know, just not so pleasant. So the waiter comes by and takes the plates away and then we sit and wait...and wait...and wait for our check. I don't really understand this because I would think that he would have wanted the check as soon as possible, but maybe he knew he did a poor job and had given up on our table. Either way, after ten more minutes or so we got the check and paid cash to avoid the inevitable long wait if paying with a credit card. The total was 27$...that's pretty pricey considering the quality of this meal...feels like a waste of money to me. So if you like having all of your food taste like peppers and that's it and over paying for that experience....this is the place for you, otherwise, I'd say skip this place."
Five,"If you're in the mood for froyo, do yourself a favor and check this family business out.\n\nWe've been here a few times and have been greeted by friendly staff with little sample cups so we can try out a new flavor or two before filling up our bowls.  So far the caramel is the family favorite. I also noticed they had a flavor of yogurt that sported even fewer calories than regular frozen yogurt. I had to check it out and I thought it tasted great!  Of course, I ended up restoring the missing calories by spooning some chocolate bar goodness into my bowl...  It was worth it.\n\nThey've got a multitude of toppings and run special discounts on certain days. On one day they'll cut you a discount if you ride or bike to the store. I thought that was pretty cool.\n\nWe'll be back!"
Five,"This place just plain rocks.  I grew up on Uncle Sam's in North Phoenix, and after moving downtown, I struggled to find a good, giant, hero.  I'm sure some yelpers could lead me in the right direction, but up until now I haven't been able to find a giant sandwich DTown.  Well, I've found it. The Hero Factory is a place for huge sandwiches. And firearms. Yes, the proprietor is a hot chick with a sidearm. The service is awesome. We came in close to closing (fyi, they aren't open weekends, and close at 3 on weekdays) and asked if they had tables outside.  The proprietor told me she would put one out for us.  This place was ready to shut down, but she offered to take a table outside so we could enjoy the weather.  Big menu, awesome service, HUGE SANDWICHES, very reasonable prices and great food.  If you get a chance, try this place./Art"
Three,"""Before I moved out, I had read about Rawhide in the tour books.  It was different from what I expected.  Not different-bad, just different.  First, it's for kids.  I didn't go with kids, but you probably should to get the most out of it.  All the shows and the little stands (like the mechanical bull and the rock climbing wall) are geared toward the under 10 set, and it would be fun to see it through their eyes.  It is also much smaller than I expected.  The piped-in music played the \Rawhide\"""" theme over and over, which I kind of loved, since I had been singing it in my head the whole drive over anyway.  I guess my final answer is this:  It's a cute theme experience, and it's something you should definitely do once, but I don't plan on going again.  In fact, when my extended family comes to visit this fall, they want to see cowboys, but I plan on finding different cowboys to show them.  Tombstone, maybe?"""""""
Three,"""Made reservations here for a 8-10 person Girls Night Out. Normally we go to the Arcadia location, but thought we'd try the Central location for a change.\nThe food & wine is the same at both places-EXCELLANT!!\nThe service at the Central location was pathetic! The young female waitress was not very knowledgeable about the wines and acted like she didnt feel like discussing or offering anything other than the wine special. (bad attitude).\nShe was very annoying and persistant about getting our drink order as soon as we sat down and before we could even look at the menu or discuss. We had asked to wait to order until our last guest arrived at the table, but she requested our drink orders 3 times in about 8 minutes, so we finally just ordered a quick glass. She was also pretty good at interrupting the tables conversation throughout the night.\n\nI ordered the olives for an appetizer and by the time my meal came, I still had not received my olives. I mentioned to our server that I had not received my olives, but that it was ok and to just 'skip them'. \nShe looked at me and said,\n  \I brought them!! They are right here!!\"""" as she reached down to the OPPOSITE end of the long table from where I was sitting and gave me a half empty bowl of olives that the other ladies had already eaten. (Not the ladies fault, as they thought they were set on the table for everyone like a bread basket.)\n  I was appalled, especially since the half eaten olives did not come with an apology, they only came with a price tag. (Thats right, she didnt even take it off the bill for me!)\n\nNote to self: The Arcadia location and male wait staff are always on the ball!"""""""
Five,"""Summary for phone Yelpers and the TLDR crowd:\nBest pizza in the area / best food in its price range in the area. There is no fault to be found with their two slices special. My favorite trio of toppings is meatball, onion, and basil. This brings you to about $5.00. The pizza slices are very large and crunch when you bite into them.\n\nThis review centers around the two slices deal.\n\nSituation:\nI work at 44th St. and Thomas and am always looking for great food on the cheap.\n\nGetting there:\nIf you're coming from the east on Indian School, turn left at 40th St as opposed to turning into the parking lot closer to Bally's. If you're coming southeast from Indian School, take 40th St. and turn left when you see the drive through liquor joint.\n\nParking:\nIt's a tight parking lot. If you're in a larger vehicle it would be best to park a little nearer to the check cashing place.\n\nMenu:\nIf you're going for the two slices deal, pick up one of the paper menus as some of the available toppings aren't featured on the big menu above the counter.\n\nOrdering:\nThe only thing to note about ordering is that they will not let you order the two slices deal in advance. This probably doesn't concern 98% of the population but is a bummer when you're meeting up with someone with limited time or want something on the run. The pizza will take between 5 - 10 minutes. They give you a small cup. China mist iced tea was added within the last six months which was nice since I try to avoid soda whenever I'm already wrecking shop on my health with the pizza.\n\nService:\nYour order will be brought to you whether you sit inside or out. The inside is a lot more comfortable since the table that cramped the interior was removed. There are misters outside.\n\nThe food:\nThe pizza is a real treat. The slices are slightly smaller than Sbarro (just a point of reference, put the flamethrowers away) but the pizza is completely different. Where a slice of NY style pizza can be folded and needs support from a second hand, Mamma Mia's remains stiff with its thin crust. Is this New Jersey style pizza? I have no idea.\n\nI haven't had a bad set of slices here. The quality is consistent though I have had some jalapenos that weren't all the way baked leaving them way to spicy for me and my ham and pineapple mix.\n\nThe only other item I've had here is the stuffed meat supreme which, from the website, is \pizza crust on top and bottom stuffed with pepperoni, sausage, ham, ricotta, mozzarella and sauce.\"""" If you've been minding some tofu diet for a month and deserve a caloric overdose; or are trying to commit suicide in a delicious way, it's a great choice.\n\nGrated Parmesan, crushed red peppers, garlic powder, and oregano are available in shakers. \n\nConclusion:\nFor being dough, sauce, and cheese, Mamma Mia really do something amazing here. This is a restaurant that I'm excited to take anyone to who hasn't yet been. If you haven't been... what are you waiting for? Look at the volume of reviews!"""""""
Five,"We had been so dismayed with the groomers in our area that my husband finally bought his own set of clippers and a grooming table! However, this summer brought us some challenges that left me on a cane and him on crutches, and it is difficult to groom a dog in that state. I called SevenDogs, explained our situation, and they booked an appointment for us the very next morning. They were very friendly, fair-priced, and they did a wonderful job! They even brought my little Schnitzel the Schoodle out to the car for me when I arrived to pick her up so I didn't have to try to handle a dog on a leash while hobbling with a cane. It looks like we have found a new groomer on whom we can depend!"
Four,"This is a nice store.  It is well organized and the shelves are neat.  In my experince when going to a store like Home Goods, Marshalls or T.J. Maxx the shelves are always a mess and it's hard to sort through it all.  That is what I've always hated about these stores.  This one is different.  And you actually see the people working on the shelves while you're there.  The bath department is well organized and neat.  They have some nice furniture although I think the prices on the furniture are a little high for what is supposed to be a discount type store.  The main reason I come here is the candles.  They usually have a nice selection of Yankee Candles for 1/3 of the price you would pay in the YC store.  I've gotten large tumblers for $9.99!  That is a steal!  I also picked up a great shower caddy for $12 that probably would have been $20 or more elsewhere.  I stop by here when I go to Sprouts which is right next door."
Four,"I have been wanting to go here for yearsssssssssss.  Typically when a restaurant has that much hype, you would expect to pay a ton of money to eat there, but I knew the pizza here is not crazy expensive, so I have no idea what held me back for so long. \n\nSo finally, on my b-day weekend, my girlfriend Abby treated me to Pizzeria Bianco, a place she been wanting to try out for a while as well. \n\nAs I'm sure many of the reviews probably already note, this place is now open for lunch. We went about 1:30 pm on a Friday and were able to grab a seat right away at the bar. The place stayed busy the whole time, even when we left at 3:00 pm, but you wouldn't have to wait more than a couple minutes for a table. \n\nI started out with one of their draft beers, not too impressed so I switched to San Tan on the next one. I loved the coziness of the place, and completely understand why there would be such a long wait in the evenings. \n\nI had the Wiseguy pizza and Abby had the Sonny Boy. Over all pretty good. I think we were both expecting to have some light shine down on us from heaven and the bartender bust out some harps as we took our first bite. The pizza was good, and in any other place I would be overly impressed but I think the years of hype stole away some of the pizza's thunder. I actually like La Bocca Urban Pizzeria better. Hope that don't break any of your hearts hearing that.\n\nEveryone should go at least one time. I wouldn't mind coming back again as well, I wish I could go before Suns games. I could probably add my name to the list before the game and get seated after! \n\nProtip: If you just want to try this place out, go for lunch. If you have time (and money) to burn, it would be a fun experience to drink next door for a couple hours, then eat some tasty fresh pizza."
Five,"This is probably my favorite Mexican restaurant in all of Phoenix.  I'm never dissappointed with their food regardless of what I order.  It's inexpensive, clean, bright, and delicious.  \n\nIt's a restaurant, market and bakery all in one building with a large seating area to enjoy the food on location.  You can buy a beer at the market and drink it along with the food you order which is cool.  And the salsa bar has shades of heat to please everyone.  \n\nThe chile rellenos are awesome and I often ordered them when I was a vegetarian.  But, if you're the type who won't eat beans with lard or rice with chicken stock, then you won't be happy here.  Now that I gave up the vegetarianism, I am thoroughly happy with the variety of flavors in the meat items.  The meat is always moist and flavorful."
Two,"""Tuesday, 5:30 pm \nMy buddy and I waltz into Lobby's because he was jonesin' for a burger and didn't want to fight the lines at In-N-Out.\n\nWhy, you ask, is Liz B. writing a review for a burger and hot dog joint when she freely admits that she has never liked meat and her parents even paid her to eat burgers as a child?

Great, friendly service.\n\nFood: Meh.\nMy veggie sandwich consisted of bread, one piece of white iceberg lettuce, two sad tomatoes, pickles, and onions for $2.99. You can add on cheese (provolone) and mushrooms or peppers for $.79 each, making your sad, awful sandwich about $5.\nMy buddy ordered the double burger with provolone, lettuce, tomato, pickles, and hot peppers. He said the hot peppers were good but not very hot. The rest of the fixings were \""""meh.\"""" As for the quality of the burger, it was a tad bit better than In-N-Out.

The rice and chicken was abundant! The chicken was seasoned to perfection and juicy, the hummus and garlic paste was a perfect companion. \n\nMy friend then had me share a mango juice and baklava with her and I was in heaven! \n\nI'm also into hookah so I was impressed with the hookah selection and tobacco!

Four,"""It took me a year and a half of living in Phoenix before I found this park one day while driving on 59th Avenue and I consider it somewhat of a hidden gem. It is nowhere near as challenging as Camelback Mountain or Piestewa Peak but in many ways I find it better.\n\nThere's always somewhere to park and it's free. The trails are well marked and easy to navigate. I think the trails are well kept and clean. Only once in awhile I'll have to dodge dog or horse poo. I never feel like I'm going to get lost while out wandering.\n\nAnother thing that was super important to me was that I feel safe hiking here alone in the early morning. Most of the people that hike here are friendly and will give a polite \Hello\"""" or \""""Good morning\"""" in passing - which I noticed some Yelpers tend to not like, what the heck? \n\nOn some portions of the trail you almost feel like you're not in the city anymore - it's that quiet.

One,"Ive been here multiple times and love their food. Living in california i come here at least once a month. Any foodie knows there is more to a restaurant experience than a great product. An amazing restaurant has three basics covered:1) customer service 2) great food offerings 3) an overall great experience. This place lacks customer service which kills the experience. I stood there on a packed Tuesday and saw 3-5 different employees walk by with no acknowledgement that I existed. No eye contact, no greeting, no words at all! After 10 mins and a line out the door I left irritated and ticked. \n\nI sympathize with the youth movement and the college atmosphere this place has, however customer service needs to be emphasized to the men and women working the floor. They are the face of your store and if this trend continues, eventually customers will get fed up and go elsewhere. If I am an owner I would be pissed if this negative behavior was going on in my business. The business acumen is very important and should be a learning tool to teach the college kids the important lessons which can be applied to all different job titles. The staff I saw working tonight looked lazy and tired. Maybe due to the high temperature of the restaurant however with poor customer service and lack of a face in the entrance greeting me with a smile and a friendly greeting, it leaves me feeling like you don't want my money and you don't care enough about your customers standing around. Eventually the attitude of we have a superior product that ppl pay for and they not have to worry about customer service will come back to bite them in the butt.\n\n\nAreas for improvement\n\nThe waiters should be focused on turning tables and getting the checks as soon as the dessert is finished as opposed to walking around with their heads cut off. More tables being turned equates to more tips. I saw 4-6 tables sitting talking on their phone when they could have been served their checks or ordered more food. My avg time from start to finish was between 90-120 mins! You cut my time in the restaurant to 60 mins with efficient service and food running from the kitchen this place could double its profits and increase tips. \n\nThey need someone to work the front and greet the customers and let them know they are wanted, appreciated and they want to provide me with a great meal! \n\nDrinks out in under 5 mins from order (I waited 20 mins and she forgot about my 2nd beer later in the evening and I had to remind her so 30 mins for a pint of beer...total wait time for 2 drinks: 50 mins\n\nNotification on food times (depends on who is working) \n\nChallenge your servers to turn tables faster \n\nServers need to be smiling and social"

Two,"My husband and I are new to the area and were really craving a good slice of pie. We did a quick online search only to find that there were very few options in Glendale...We chose Shelly's because it was closest to our house. We walked in and I was immediately unimpressed. It didn't smell like fresh baked goodies, and the display cases were full of sub- par looking pastries. Shelly was very friendly however, and offered us a sample of the buttermilk pie. It was decent, but pretty rich..share a slice! My husband decided to try the peach pie after Shelly hyped up the fresh local peaches she uses. I stuck to the buttermilk pie as the sample was decent and I wasn't feeling particularly adventurous. I ate a few bites but was too overwhelmed by the sweetness and offered the rest to my husband, his peach pie was 80% hard crumb topping and 15% slimy crust ( had defiantely been sitting in the fridge for at least a week.) The teeny amount of peach filing was bitter and goopy. I give Shelly an A for effort, but we will NOT be returning."

Ohhhh, that gravy!\nWe save the biscuits for last - and smother them with butter and honey - dessert!\n\nEverything has always been fresh and tasty. No culinary risks here, and nothing pushing the food envelope - just straightforward Texas comfort food. With some added flair. Cajun/Creole flavors make lots of appearances - and it all hits the spot.\n\nThe decor can be overwhelming - but there's so much eye candy it's impossible to be bored. Love all the signs and bumper stickers. Most are Texas-centric, but there are artifacts from all over the globe.

I went back and got my money back and the person at the desk was smart enough to cancel my next appointment.  Unfortunately, they didn't even think to give me my $5 tip back for the service.  What really bothered me was that they didn't admit any culpability in the event--simply mentioned that the wax was the \normal temperature.\""""  Now clearly that was NOT the case as I've gone there for 2 years with no prior incidents.  If the wax was the right temperature then how did I get burned?  Simply defies logic.

I volunteer at the nearby museum and end up there at least a couple of times a month. Every time I leave, I do go with a smile on my face. The building itself is adorable. The food is always top notch. They offer a wide variety of beers you would never expect to find in such a small, hidden away place. And!! And they support the local arts and offer all kinds of free java-esque reading materials outside. \nThat being said, over the months, I have had to train myself to leave The Orange Table completely happy because I have learned to expect some of the slowest, most incompetent service I have ever received anywhere. Period. I have walked out more than once because of being completely ignored by the staff from the onset. Once you place your order, the food does come out pretty quickly, but actually placing it is a challenge on the part of the customer. I often have to drag my friends to the restaurant so I can order my favorite Chipotle Chicken Sandwich. They have been through \The Orange Table Experience\"""" too and often do not want to go back just so they can avoid the frustration.\nThis restaurant can run circles around any other small Scottsdale lunch spot in so many ways, but I feel that if the service does not change soon, I may be the last one who will put up with the hassle of simply having lunch there."""""""
One,"""Despite my monthly use of Frontline Plus... my dog came home COVERED in tiny ticks after being here for 4 days.  The facilities did not appear the cleanest and now I'm suffering from taking my dog there!  When I called to inform them of this, they told me I must not have used Frontline and that no other dogs had ticks however, they also did not tell me MY dog had ticks.  I definitely would NOT recommend this facility.  Please save your dog and take him/her somewhere else!\n\nIn response to their response (on Kudzu which couldn't fit my whole response!):\nI NEVER asked for money back.  I asked for advice on getting the ticks off my dog.  Maybe you shouldn't assume and try to LISTEN to what I was saying.  I'm concerned about my dog as I have a medical degree and know about Lyme disease.  These are small ticks which are more likely to transmit Lyme disease.  Nothing like a trip to the vet after work tomorrow to make for a great start to the week!\nAlso here's some information from the Frontline website:\n\FRONTLINE Plus offers long-lasting flea and tick control, killing up to 100% of fleas on your pet within 18 hours and up to 100% of ticks on your pet within 48 hours. Best of all, research confirms that FRONTLINE products work for an entire month to help keep your pet flea-free.\""""\nNotice: it says kills in 48 hours (probably more than 50 of the ticks were dead but some where still alive but as they kindly pointed out it has been 24 hours).  And it says keeps them FLEA free not TICK free.  Maybe I just have a doctorate degree but I can read.  Please do not try to insult me--I just don't want other people to spend hours upon hours getting ticks off their dogs after your facility!\nAnd as far as it taking me 24 hours to notice--some people work and when you get home from trips your first reaction might not be to check your hairy dog for ticks!  They were hidden in his coat; I found it after work today when giving him a nice neck scratch!  Only to find many, many more...\nAnd, obviously this was NOT the first time this happened as you do require proof of flea treatment which I did provide and used two weeks ago (but as you can see it's not FULL-PROOF!).  In addition, you mention the amount of ticks you have on your grounds and the treatments you have to do.  Maybe I'm just reading into this too much...\nAnd FYI my CONDO is clean.  There has never been a dog in here at least since it was remodeled--the previous tenant is my landlord!  But yet again, assume what you want but for readers understand how dishonest they are being!\n\nIf suddenly there are lots of good reviews...just think who is probably doing that...the owners probably?"""""""
Four,"""Very good pizza. I had the Italian Stallion. If you love meat this is your choice. Crust cooked very well in the wood burning oven. Pretty good lunch crowd. Service was good. My only complaint is that the smallest pie is 12\. Great for 2. Too much for one. While cold pizza is great at 7 AM after sleeping one off, it is so much better when still retaining original heat. Maybe if they offer a single serve pie lunch could stay under $20 for one."""""""
Five,"Inexpensive, classy, clean, casual, and a good sign of cultural development in central Phoenix. Film Bar not only has an excellent lineup of indie and foreign films, but a bar stocked with excellent regional microwbrews. The staff is helpful when you cant choose between your familiar old lager or a new IPA. Always have had a good experience every time I come for a film. This theater is not for everyone, but it sure is welcome and needed in the Valley for the population that it serves."
One,"I have been here a couple times. The first time I went it was still under the Shanghai Palace name. I heard that Shanghai Palace was the only place in town that had soup dumplings. When I went I turned out the place changed hands to Tottie. Well I had already made my trip there from the air port. My friend who was with me who is also a chef decided to try out some of their dim sum and some apps. The dim sum items were over steamed and were dried out on top. Even the eggrolls were horrible. We noticed the sushi bar and the millions of items on the menu. I would never order something that not the specialty for the restaurant. I mean yeah asian fusion is good when done right but this place is far from that. It is just a bunch of different types of Asian food and non of it is fusion just traditional done wrong!\n\nThe second time I went I decided to give them a shot. I heard their Pho was good. Although I think Tottie is a Thai specialty. Well I have to say that not only was the service mediocre and we had to keep asking for water, I found a long, I mean real long, knotted hair in my pho. Of course I find it at the end of my meal and I nearly threw up on the table when I pulled out the hair from my mouth. \n\nNot only is the food horrible, it's dirty and service sucks. I can handle bad food if the place was clean and they had good service. I don't think I ever saw any of the staff wash their hands after touching their hair, face or what not before serving food. Gross. You will never see me back here again. This might be a harsh review but I gave them 2 chances."

But please don't go there during Glendale Glitters because it's so hard to get a table during the festivites and I really want to get a seat this time."""""""
Four,"Let's get something straight.... I'm not really a donut person. I don't mind an occasional donut with the right company. But for the most part, I don't care about donuts. However....\n\nFor some reason, I was recently craving a donut. Maybe there's something in the Phoenix water that makes me do that. I'm not sure. Anyway, I was getting some work done at a nearby cafe and decided to look for a donut shop. Thank you fellow yelpers for introducing me to this little gem. The donuts are super cheap and really yummy. I've been here multiple times and usually opt for the buttermilk bar. Tip: The buttermilk bars at this location are tastier and bigger than the ones at the Tempe location. I've had the chocolate cruller and that one is yummy too.\n\nConsidering I'm not much of a donut fan, I will admit that I crave them more since I found this place. If you're looking for an inexpensive yummy treat, I say give this place a shot!"
Three,"Craving french toast?  Look no further!  Tasty french toast with butter and maple syrup..what else do you really need!   We had the french toast, roasted potatoes, and the sausage and gravy  with biscuits..all was tasty.\n\nSweet vanilla dipped french toast..I gobbled it up and could have had another plate.  The gravy was very thick and full of sausage..and kind of spicy.  The biscuits didn't really look like biscuits more like rolls.\n\nScramble seems to get really busy on the weekends!  Long lines to wait to order and then you have to find a place to eat. We would've sat outside however, the tables were wet.   The staff was really friendly and definitely were helpful in clearing tables to get the next group seated.  However, we had a family who just kept coming and asking us to move over, very annoying.  One of the daughters almost sat on my friend's purse and was not even apologetic for doing so, and then another person came and asked us to move again.  We just ended up leaving because they were annoying for sure and I was just thinking they would have another 3 family members wanting to sit next to them and it doesnt make the best experience for other guests.  So I think somehow, Scramble needs to figure out how to manage large groups, because it was very annoying.  We would've left a tip for the girls but was just annoyed that we left since it felt like we were getting kicked out.  So , go over the week, to avoid these family groups.   \n\nScramble , I will be back but just not the weekends, I don't want to keep moving around while I'm trying to enjoy your  tasty french toast!"
Four,"I love this Walgreens.  I love that it's right down the street from my work.  I LOVE  that there's a Take Care Clinic inside (which I only have to pay a $20 copay via my insurance) if I need to see a NP.  I love that I can get not only my meds but also make digital photo prints while waiting for those meds.  Love the fact that I can go in at 2pm or 2am and find what I need - Gotta love 24hr locations!!\n\nShoot even if I did need something at 2am, I'd still drive to this location rather than the 24hr location off Thomas and 36th Street.  Without even thinking twice about the distance."
Four,"Ok, so they do deserve more stars than 3.\n\nDespite some of the more negative reviews for Bar 7, they really are a decent establishment. Here are some tips to hopefully help you have a better experience:\n\n-ask to sit in the lounge. It is much nicer than the restaurant seating and less noisy\n-go for dinner, especially Friday and Saturday nights. They have Fish Fry Fridays and usually Prime Rib or Fried Chicken specials on Saturdays.\n-don't opt for mashed potatoes or twice baked potatoes, they don't taste as good as a plain regular baked potato.\n-utilize the salad bar. All the dinner items (not burgers, sandwiches, etc.) come with soup/salad bar in addition to the veggie side and potato side. \n-get a cocktail. They are always a decent pour and not over the top expensive ($3.25 for single well cocktail).\n-appetizers and desserts are generally not required as dinner portions are ample. They are however, tasty if you want to order anyways ;)"
Four,"If you've been in Nordstrom's, you've probably seen this little cafe tucked away in the back.  It took me awhile to finally decide to eat there after seeing it dozens of times.  \n\nThe cafe is a little more upscale than what you'll find down in the food court, and the menu consists of salad, sandwiches, soup and pasta.  They also have a few really good desserts, including a great cheesecake.  \n\nAll in all, the food is pretty good and prices are decent for being a cafe in Nordstrom's, but I still think Tomatoes is the best place to eat in the mall."
Four,"Saturday 11:30 AM nothing seemed to be calling to us.....then we smelled meat.....we weren't sure where it was coming from but, in true carnivore fashion, I started following the smell......\n\nWhen we got to the corner of Boston and Arizona, we lost the scent....\n\nWe crossed over, hoping to find it but it was gone.....but we found ourselves in front of Brunchies.  Not being familiar with it but always a sucker for a good indie restaurant, we just had to go in.  I think we got the last two seats in the place so I thought - it can't be bad.\n\nAnd, my instincts were right-on!  What a gem we found in Brunchies!\n\nFirst and foremost, the coffee.  Good and hot!  Nothing makes a meal forgettable like lousy or lukewarm coffee.  This was hot and the waitress kept the cups refilled to the point where I think we were floating out the door.\n\nNow, the food. \n\nI ordered the Multi-grain combo, which is 3 multigrain cakes with almonds and walnuts, an egg, and meat. I hate places that force me into potatoes or toast along with the cakes - seriously, why carbo load??  And these pancakes - well, if you told me they had pixie dust in them, I would not be surprised because they were simply magically awesome cakes,  They were so full of nuts and flavor - I truly can say of all of the multi-grain cakes I have had anywhere, these were hands-down the best.  I had a sunnyside egg which was cooked nicely and not overdone.  And the bacon was fairly crispy.  All in all, a great breakfast!\n\nDH ordered the Chorizo skillet.  Now, DH is not a small fellow and it takes alot for him to admit defeat, but that skillet did him in.  It was a wonderful combo of sausage, eggs, potatoes, cheese, chilis, and onions.  The flavors were great and he said the Chorizo was exceptional, better than most places we have had since we landed in AZ several months ago.\n\nWe did not opt for a cinnamon roll but I gather that must be one popular item as we seemed to be the ONLY table not ordering one... what I want to know is, how did they have room for one?? Yeow. we could barely finish our breakfasts, there was no room for a roll :)  Maybe next time, we can pace ourselves better ;)"
Five,"After startingmy adventures in Phoenix  @ Scottsdale community college i learned the hard way that not everything in Scottsdale is grander . I love paradise. It appears to be very clean, and the staff is definitely more patient, friendly and professional.

Four,"We have been here twice now and have had great food AND great service both times.  Have not been during happy hour, but left around when it was starting and there was a line out the door.  It's a very small but clean and nicely decorated sushi bar.  Not a big fan of the raw stuff, but have tried some of their specialty baked rolls and they are delicious.  My favorite is the Teriyaki chicken roll and the heart attack.  They only serve soda in a can, which is the only negative I found in this small little strip mall Sushi bar!  So go try it!"
Four,"""Life can be clouded...and in this case my review is clouded by Sergio Mendoza y La Orkesta.  The Sail Inn could be a rail car next to a chemical plant that serves only overpriced fertilizer cocktails and it would still start at 3 stars because of the Sergio show.\n\nFortunately, it does not appear to be next to a chemical plant and while there may have been a few women there who clearly had been drinking something similar to fertilizer infused drinks, I don't think they were overpriced.\n\nThe outdoor stage is great, not too big, not too small.  And, for an outdoor stage, the sound is very good.  The crowd is a good mix, and actually, despite the location, not a \Mill Ave\"""" crowd by any means.  The indoor bar area is also nice with a somewhat odd \""""lounge\"""" area to the side where you can go make out with someone you meet at the bar, if you are in to that...the bartenders have the right amount of attitude and do a good job of getting drinks out.  About 10 beers on draft, nothing special, includes Bass and Sierra Nevada.  Overall it feels slightly like Miami Vice, well except for your clothes, I hope...and the hippy chicks dancing to the late night jam band.\n\nNot sure I would go here for no good reason, but the venue is clearly bringing in some good musicians, so if you see something you like, go."""""""

Five,"""An interesting little surprise on a First Friday--the electric blue neon letters spelled out my beacon when searching for something to drink.  \n\nSmall businesses don't get much smaller.  Inside is about as unassuming as you can get.  The bar splits the old duplex's front room in a strictly utilitarian fashion.  Bottles of Monin flavor syrup crowd one side, a vintage ice machine near a single cash register and a small hand-drawn menu on the wall round the place out.   \n\nThe raw entrepreneurial spirit that adds to the late night fare downtown can be pretty inspiring sometimes, and I'm kicking myself for not doing it first.  I reasoned downtown didn't need another coffee shop, and I was proven wrong with a place that fills a void I didn't know existed.\n\nWhat I like about this place is what's not here.  There are no knick-knacks to up-sell, nothing that beckons the over-done scenes found at coffeehouses elsewhere.  There's nothing to take away from a kickass cup of coffee when you want it except what appeared to be a delightful-looking waffle-cone carried out of the back.  \n\nThe place was *swamped* on First Friday, but despite the rush it never once felt claustrophobic.  The line shuffled quickly, and my drink was made lickety split, faster than other coffee shops that have a fraction of the crowd.  It arrived so fast, I actually didn't believe it was mine, especially when it seemed the barista was new.  A good sign for his future there.  \n\nThe cashier was friendly and we welcomed each other to the neighborhood.  She made sure I got my 10th JoBot Free card.  \n\nBut you know what the best part was?   I casually noted the price of the large $4 latte.  I can't drink cow's milk, so I get soy.  And coffee is just boring without a flavor shot.  \n\nAnywhere else I go, that \$4\"""" drink is at least $6.  At JoBot, it was still $4.  \n\nWhen she told me that, I had been repeatedly counting my dollar bills, pondering the final damage of my add-ons.  Needless to say, I didn't believe her.  \n\nPractically everything has its catch, its obnoxious little down-side.  \n\nExcept JoBot.  Thank you Mr. Sagasta.\n\n10/10."""""""
Five,"""I went to this new establishment with some friends for a mid week lunch. I love Thai food and this certainly hit the spot. While a bit pricey for lunch ($60 for three people) the quality of the food is well worth it. From the moment we walked in I knew this was a good choice. The walls are painted BRIGHT green and purple, with a huge green plastic banana(?) leaf on one wall. Since everything is vegetarian the meats are \meats\"""". I had a soy \""""chicken\"""" dish which was the best, densest, most delicous tofu ever. EVER! I seriously want to replicate it at home but I'll fail miserably.

One,"""It doesn't help that the evening ended with me telling the manager/owner exactly what was wrong with all the food that I had tried there and him walking back in shaking his head in a surprisingly unprofessional manner.

Oh, and although I pointed out specific problems in technique, he blew my issues off as being just \a matter of taste\"""".  Mind you, I was the only asian in that establishment - kitchen, and otherwise.\n\nKorean tacos - there is NOTHING Korean about these tacos.  We don't use shredded meat for one, its way too salty and all I tasted that had a Korean link was Soy Sauce (maybe some brown sugar?).  Owner/manager guy said of course its Korean, it has Korean spices in it.  I don't think he knows anything about Korean cuisine....\n\nCalifornia rolls - how do you mess these up?  I guess by not putting anything but crabmeat and a tiny bit of cucumber that was poorly matchsticked.  These were so bland, I ended up putting some of the Korean taco meat filling on top and added some of the shell crumbled up for texture.\n\nEel/Dragon roll - the Dragon roll had one thick slice of avocado across 3 pieces of the roll.  The eel was over done in sauce that tasted almost burnt - its either not seasoned right or over caramelized.  Of course this same sauce is found on the Eel sushi.\n\nThe Peanut butter Jellyfish roll - this was actually not too bad.  Nothing to write home about, but not completely wrong like everything else.\n\nI put pretty much all the wasabi we received into about half the saucer of soy sauce and could barely taste it.  Is it fake?  The rolls were also sliced unevenly, which is a fine detail that you appreciate at good sushi restaurants.  They were also not rolled tightly enough, so everything fell apart pretty much as soon as you grabbed it.\n\nAll in all, never again."""""""
One,"I played there in Mid July. I would not recommend playing this course. It is very short and plays very slow. There were (2) groups waiting on many of the tees. The best part of the experience was the pro shop. It makes you think you are in for something very special. Everything after leaving the clubhouse is old. Old carts, old style golf course, a 225 yard par (4) on the back nine. Silly and dangerous as you cannot see the green,  just about anyone is capable of flying it on the green. \n\nIt was cart path only when I played and they had lost much of the turf. \nThe view of the city on 18 is terrific, but going thru (5) hours of golf on this dog track is not worth the wait."
Four,"This hotel is called the Lexington, although our GPS took us to Best Western. We stayed here as part of our road-trip honeymoon and really liked it.

The staff was incredibly friendly and the continental breakfast was yummy and, as far as these things go, pretty expansive. The only thing keeping this from a 5-star (in terms of value) is that you have to walk through a nasty-smelling, creepy looking hallway to get in and out of the parking lot, which isn't that big a deal, but still very gross and upsetting. Otherwise though this place was great and definitely worth the money!!"
Three,"A very cute place where you can eat and shop! The shop had trinkets, expensive clothes, and candy. Very random.\n\nThe food isn't too bad. I had the Counter Chopped salad ($6.25) with turkey, blue cheese, grapes, candied pecans, and a lemon poppy seed dressing. The salad ingredients were fresh, and I loved the candied pecans. \n\nA friend had the grilled cheese sandwich. omg.. it took like 15 minutes just to get a grilled cheese.. I have no idea why the cooks took so long!! Just place a slice of American cheese in between two breads, melt, and wham!

Four,I went here Friday night with a group of friends to celebrate a wedding anniversary and we had so much FUN at this unassuming little place!\n\nSoul Power  -- a regular band here -- played and they were awesome. The bongo player invited me to beat out a few different songs with him. They're totally chill and friendly but very talented. Great music.\n\nI love the atmosphere. People were friendly and just having a great time. My girls and I get a bit over the top when there's music and dancing but people acted cool about it.\n\nThere is a small dance floor at the feet of the musicians and people used it.

Three,"Working in the business area of Washington and Priest and only having 30 minutes for lunch sucks. Usually it's an epic race against time to pick something up and make it back to my desk before it's too late. \n\nToday I decided that I was going to attempt to make it to Rally's and it was a great success. The drive-thru was completely dead, so I was able to make it back with time to spare. Personally, I think the burgers here are average but the thing that has me coming back for more is the fries. Their fries rock! Tasty and crisp, they make my fat ass happy. The only downside to this location is that the placement of the store is pretty bad and to get back on Priest can be a real pain in the ass. They also have a really bad pigeon problem outside so if you're eating there beware! Those birds are swift and dangerous and extremely hungry.

So, today at lunch, I swung by and tried it out.  I'm happy I did.  They are hidden away being over powered by a liquor store on the corner of Virgina and 7th St.  The inside is freshly painted, has a TV, and modern decor.  I don't believe the AC was working cause it was warm, but they had the fans going.  I doubt this is normal.  The three guys working there were super duper nice.  I love it when the cook waves to you.  The host/cashier was very helpful since it was my first time.  I had to go with the Not from Philly sandwich.  It tastes sooo good.  Kinda reminds me of White Castle (that is a really really good thing for me).  Amazing quality of meat and very fresh ingredients.  The bread is so soft on the inside and crispy on the outside and is the perfect amount.  How do they do it?!  It's MAGIC!  LOVE IT!

Two,"""I love the concept, I love the decor, I love the idea, hopefully the food can catch up. \n\nWe knew going opening week would be under par as the staff tries to gain their groove, so we went in with I'd say low expectations. We weren't disappointed. Our server knew nothing about the products on the menu or the beverages offered. \n\nMy friends each got craft brews and were offered non-chilled glasses, they opted to just drink out of the bottle. I tried the Strawberry fields cocktail. It tasted purely of artificial syrup - nothing fresh about it, and I couldn't tell if the Vodka made it in the glass or not.\n\nWe decided to start with the Pretzel and then each opted for different Brats so we could share and get a variety. The pretzel didn't come out till the brats did - so much for ordering an app. When it did finally arrive it was a very dark brown and somewhat mangled look,  we could have gotten past that if it at least tasted good, but not only was this pretzel an eye sore, it was a mouth sore. It was everything you don't want a pretzel to be - tough, chewy and burnt. Finally, the Brats... the Brats themselves weren't bad, but the Brat:Bread Ratio was way off. We received these huge Brat buns that were easily double the size of the actual brat. I wouldn't call myself a Brat aficionado I just can't imagine how you screw up such a simple and easy item - especially if you are the \Brat Haus\"""". The one item of the whole evening actually worth noting was the Apricot Chutney, it was flavorful and the only reason I was able to finish my bready meal. \n\nI would be up to giving them another chance, it seems everyone else had a much better experience.

Four,"I moved into Hyde Park Apartments and have to say, I'm pleasantly surprised by how well run the complex is. In the past, my experience with with apartment complex management has been... unimpressive. Nevertheless, not everything is perfect, either.\n\nTHE GOOD\n- Management is super responsive, super helpful, and really do seem like they're there to HELP you instead of just take your rent check. I have had to contact them several times about a few issues, all of which they have tried to resolve same-day.\n- Management also has lots of small perks for residents. They send out birthday cards, have Halloween bags available for trick-or-treaters, offer drawings for prizes every month for folks who pay rent early, etc. These small treats add up.\n- Prices and ongoing new resident lease specials make it worth your while to live here.\n\nTHE BAD\n- Despite having same-day help, my toilet STILL does not flush well. Since I've moved in it has had a very weak (sometimes incomplete) flushing mechanism. I've had several people check it out, including a guy's whose snake got caught within the pipes. It has improved, but is still terrible.\n- While the residents aren't particularly noisy, the floors/ceilings are quite thin so you can always hear your neighbors walking about. There are lots of children too that play together in the grass outside.\n\nTHE UGLY\n- I've found and killed two roaches in my kitchen since moving in. Management does offer a terminator to come in and spray, but with animals in the house I tend to do this myself just so I know a) what poison I'm using and b) where the poison has been sprayed.\n\nOverall, I'm pleased with this complex. The imperfections are either not a part of management's control, or just a result of an older building, and I am looking forward to living out my lease here."

We wanted to top off a great evening with a nice cup of Joe and Press Coffee was closed at 7pm and it was 7:30pm, oh no.... so we stopped by Star Bucks.\n\nThe service started off as a standard Star Bucks, quick to greet, though missing the smile this time, and ready to make what ever caffeinated concoction your craving for.\n\nCoffee #1 ~ decaf and sugar free vanilla syrup. Barista stated, \we are out to decaf, would regular coffee be ok?\"""" What??  No, we would like a decaf please.  Barista, \""""that will take 10 mins, so you will need to wait\"""".  We asked, why are you out of decaf? Barista, \""""we stop making decaf earlier in the day\"""". We did not want to wait so we opted for a leaded brew.\n\nCoffee #2 ~ regular coffee with sugar free caramel.  I watched the Barista and noticed she used the white pump for the sugar free vanilla and the brown pump for the sugar free caramel. Star Bucks used one collar for sugar free and the other for sugared syrups.  As she poured our coffee I asked her to please make sure she gave us sugar free and not sugar. I noticed you used both colored pumps.  Barista, snippy ~ \""""we don't separate our flavorings like the other Star Bucks\"""". She then dumped our coffee's out and using the same cups proceeded to use the same pumps again...  \n\nSo we got both coffee's and proceeded to the cream bar and there was no cream...  So I asked a different barista for some cream.  She stated, \""""here ya go\"""" and placed a gallon carton of cream on the bar and walked off.\n\nWowsers!  The coffee tasted burned as though it had been sitting there a while and we were for sure if we were drinking sugar free.  No sugar comma later so we are ok and don't plan to go back to this Star Bucks for a while..."""""""
Four,"My wife and I keep coming back here!  Maybe it's just the convenience, but whatever the reason we're always stuffed to the gills and very happy with the food and service.  We went in recently for the Champagne brunch (buffet) and enjoyed a selection of things we hadn't tried before.  We arrived about 12:30 (on Sunday) and found about 10 other people in the restaurant.  Over the next hour, people were pouring in, large groups, families.  It appears to be a very popular buffet!\n\nThe servers were very attentive, the food was fresh and very good.  The spice level seemed pretty mild, so if you have a thing for hot-n-spicy, you'll need to order a side of hot sauce."
Five,"""This place was, in a word, AWESOME. For those who don't know, one of my favorite places in THE WORLD is Sammy's Roumanian Steakhouse in Manhattan.  This place actually reminds me a LOT of that place, which is great to have right in my neighborhood (not to mention right next to my favorite strip club, but that's another review).\n\nCame here with a group of ladies on Saturday night, and we had so much fun. I mean, how many items need to be delivered to your table ON FIRE before you start having a good time?  Hint: It doesn't take many. However, our mid-twenties asses were put to shame by the biggest party animal of the night, 90 Year old Mildred. This chick was celebrating her birthday with 75 of her closest friends and was scooting around that place with a vengeance. It was incredible. According to the wonderful owners we chatted with, she E-VITED her guests.  Yes, a 90 year old woman learned how to E-VITE specifically to invite 75 friends to Bacchanal.  That may not be entirely accurate, but I wouldn't doubt it.\n\nI had the Veal Bacchanal, Aimee H. had the lamb skewer, and our two friends had the Greek Lasagna and the Lamb Shank.  My veal was very good, but the Lamb Shank that I tried was incredible! Like fall off the bone tender. But it was huge, and I was filling up on wine and ouzo, so I was satisfied with my bites.\n\nReally though, the experience itself is worth five stars. Yes, the food isn't inexpensive (around $15-$20 for an entree...but they have a gyro plate for $10 as well), but they could have charged $5 at the door for the entertainment alone. Belly dancers, a live band, freaking throwing plates on the ground! Obviously, the way to any girl's heart is condoned destruction of property, so they did a great job recognizing that.\n\nOkay this is a long review, but go when they have the belly dancers and band, get the lamb and some ouzo shots, and throw some plates on the ground. If you don't have a good time, you should maybe re-evaluate your definition of \good time\"""". That is all."""""""
Five,"""WOWZEEWOWWOW!!!!!  This place is nice.  This was the nicest and largest \regular\"""" hotel room I've stayed in.  As I travel a little, I've stayed in several.  HUGE room, balcony with patio-table and 2 chairs, comfy, comfy, bed, a sofa and small sitting area, the standard desk, separate make-up area, small bar sink in the room, bathroom separated from room with a wall and small hallway.\n\nSuper fast and friendly service from room service and housekeeping. \n\nALL staff on the grounds were incredibly courteous. I can only imagine how much training must go into this- how do you get everyone from the bellman to the front desk staff to the coffee cart lady to the groundspeople to housekeeping to room service to ALL be friendly and professional????? I don't know, but this hotel has managed to do it. \n\nHotel offers a shuttle that runs every hour on the hour to designated local Scottsdale destinations, but if you're really nice, the oh so cool bellman/shuttle driver will drop you where you want to go in Scottsdale (be sure to tip him well for that extra service!).\n\nThe place is HUGE, and it's not all in one building.  It's sort of laid out like a sprawling apartment complex or maybe college campus.\n\nWatch the mini-bar prices, and room service add on charges. Nothing unusual, just the outlandish stuff all hotels charge.\n\nOverall, I have nothing to complain about. Nothing at all. The \""""WOW\"""" factor is truly in effect here."""""""
Four,"""On our latest visit here, we ordered the meatball sub, and the eggplant parm sub--specifically because the owner sent me a very polite e-mail.  He was right.\nThe eggplant this time was not greasy.  It was delicious and perfectly cooked.  The flavors were very delicate and it was very lightly spiced.  Delicious!\nThe meatballs this time were hugely better as well!  Firmer, more flavorful and much less salty.  Yummy!\n\nAs usual, the breads are delicious and the crab pasta salad with dill (the owner said it was his own recipe) was \smack yo momma\"""" good!\n\nI'm still having a problem with the desserts.  This time I ordered a Napoleon to go.  Now, let me say that Napoleons are my favorite dessert.  When I see them anywhere, I order one. PERIOD. This one was disappointing.  It had a chewy, gluey, texture.  The filling was just OK, and I wasn't a big fan of the flavor of the icing.  Just an overall disappointment.\n\nOverall, definitely better than three stars.  The owner was absolutely correct, and I want to thank him for contacting me, otherwise I would never have had that fantastic eggplant parm!"""""""
Four,"""I know The Breakfast Club has been here since at least a year or two before I moved from AZ (which was a little over 3 years ago) and I never tried it until this past week when I was in town for the Holidays.  I can remember many a Saturday & Sunday mornings being driven back to Old Town (often times by my mother) to retrieve my car from the night before and always debating on grabbing a hangover breakfast here, but I never did.\n\nAnyways, I came here for lunch and I really liked it.  Apparently this place has had a pretty extensive renovation recently and is quite a bit bigger than it once was.  It was crowded and we had a bit of wait for a table (and this was on a Tuesday).  From what I understand this is often times the case here.\n\nOne of the reasons this place never really tickled my fancy is because something about it just always seemed pretentious for whatever reason, but that's not the case at all.  Sure, the decor is nicer than Denny's but it's still pretty comfortable.  Both the the breakfast & lunch menus sounded delicious & hearty.  I was surprised.  The portions were big & there was several options. \n\nI decided to go w/a lunch option (the grilled chicken sandwich), and it was delicious.  It came w/sweet potato fries, which were good.  Between the sandwich and the fries there was quite a bit of food on my plate for only about $8.  Most of the breakfast & lunch items are around &10 and under.  \n\nEven though this place isn't pretentious like I thought it would be when I ordered a diet coke our waitress informed me that they only have \natural soda in bottles.\""""  However, I'm giving brownie points because as the waitress was telling me this she rolled her eyes (not at me, but at how ridiculous that is).  \n\nOverall, I really enjoyed Breakfast Club and it's a solid breakfast and/or lunch option in Scottsdale."""""""
One,"""I used to love this place! With that being said, so many changes have occurred there that make this place completely undesirable to me.  I thought this was supposed to be a gay bar. Now I only know of one staff member that is, in fact, gay. Is the management attempting to phase out the gay staff? No accusations here, but I do find it odd that the familiar gay faces are disappearing. I enjoyed stopping in, being greeted by staff with smiles; staff that could make a great drink, and fast! The statement that Jason B. makes, writing that Amsterdam has \the determination and innovation to make itself a gay bar destination\"""" is not necessarily true anymore. It seems we can no longer refer to Amsterdam as \""""gay\"""" but must downgrade it to \""""gay friendly\"""". \n\nThe space has undergone some updates over the past year and is absolutely beautiful, but what has happened to the clientele? I mean in regard to the violent and angry attitudes leading to the increasing occurrence of fights and one outright brawl a couple weekends ago. Most sincere thanks to the staff for doing something to attempt to stop the fight!  Where was security?\n\nSorry all, but this familiar face won't be coming by anymore. When I go out I want drinks, hanging out with friends, meeting new friendly people, and maybe some dancing, not a Vegas boxing match!"""""""
Five,"Brunch on Sunday after New Years was perfection!  First, the setting is magnificent with splendid table settings, modern design and superb views.  We were warmly welcomed and given a view table.  Excellent Spanish sparkling wine promptly served while awaiting friends.  Fresh squeezed OJ brought in beaker to make our own mimosas.  Bloody Mary's can be ordered at a hefty charge, but not needed when bubbly is included.  Buffet is modest compared to some, but here quality wins out with nicely displayed salads, fruits, cheeses, cold meats, fantastic smoked salmon, cold shrimp, crab and bagels, breads, etc.  Huge omelets are included and made to order.  Do not miss the buffet of small desserts--all outstanding in appearance and taste.  The pecan pie miniature was my favorite.  Superb service with silver and plates changed as required without asking.  Will not wait for New Years to return."
Three,"This place was a laugh!.....in a good way.....we had just ordered when a simulated lighting storm occurred....the lights were flashing, thunder was booming and all of the animatronics were screeching......We just had to try this place as I had never experienced anything like this in Australia....the restaurant came complete with a night sky with twinkling stars, a fog machine around the bar, huge tropical fish tanks and bar stools in the shape of animal rears and feet!.....Our waitress was great.....and the food was good.....we did not expect 5 star dining as clearly this is the last place you would go if you were feeling 5 star....it is essentially for children but we had fun as we still have a lot of child in us. My husband had the coconut shrimp which was actually very good and I had the English style fish and chips which I have to say was not very English but the fish was very tasty. Great for a casual bite and to entertain the children......not sure if you want to take very young young children here though as it can get quite noisy and some of the very young ones looked quite concerned!"
Five,"An oasis of Natural healing and Alternative Medicine. Some of the finest Naturopathic Doctors in the country work and teach at this clinic. I may be a little biased since I currently work here, but prior to that i was also a patient. I feel what this center offers is so unique and so needed that its importance cannot be understated. Here patients get to see medically trained alternative medicine practitioners. That means that the doctors on staff went through rigorous medical training AND training in alternative and natural therapies.... in a nutshell you get the BEST OF BOTH WORLDS. Moreover the docs on staff here have years of experience treating all kind of conditions from the mundane colds and flus all the way up to the most complex medical conditions like auto-immune disease, cancer, diabetes, etc. The clinic operates both as a healing center and as a teaching clinic. you can either be seen on a 'student rotation' where you're seen by students supervised by one of the doctors at a heavily discounted rate, or can pay more and see one of the physicians privately. Since its a teaching clinic, wait times can sometimes be a little longer, however the quality of care you receive is unparalleled in today's medical system. Top notch institution, would recommended it to anyone seeking high quality medical care at an affordable price."
One,"""We were in town for some sunshine, and we were excited to check out the breweries around.  Went to Four Peaks and Papago and were very pleased with the service, food, and beer.  We hit up Sun Up the following day hoping for an equally pleasurable experience.  That couldn't have been further from reality...\n\nWe got a sampler of their 6 regular brews as well as a sample of their 2 seasonals.  We had to choke down almost every one of them (the exception was their seasonal amber, which wasn't too bad but not worth ordering more than 4 oz of).  The waitstaff was not very friendly at all and seemed miffed that we didn't want food or more beer.  After chugging what beer I could and having a glass of water, I hit the restroom before leaving.  Wow.  Big mistake.  It smelled like an outhouse in there-- the \poo fermenting in the middle of summer but you've had to pee so bad after a 4 hour hike so you'll go anyway but hold your breath\"""" kind of outhouse. Ick :P\n\nPerhaps I am biased because we are from Fort Collins and are spoiled with the likes of New Belgium, O'Dells, and Equinox all within a couple miles of our house.  However, the service and stinky bathrooms were bad enough that had their beer been phenomenal, I still would have just given this place 3 stars...maybe.\n\nIf you're looking for good local beer, hit up Papago or Four Peaks instead and save your money (and beer belly) for something tastier!"""""""
Three,"Checked out Agave this past weekend with friends that live in the area. They hadn't been there in a while so we off we went. We were seated right away and checked out the menu. Our friends remarked that it looked like the menu had been slightly revamped.  We started with the Sonoran Rolls (tortillas with grilled fish, avocado and pico de gallo) and the Fried Camarones (battered shrimp).  The shrimp was so fried, it was tough to bite into. The Sonoran Rolls were better but nothing to write home about.  They just weren't very flavorful.  \nI had the spinach enchiladas which were pretty good.  I'm kind of a wimp when it comes to hot foot and the red chili sauce wasn't spicy at all. That worked for me, but might not for someone who likes a little kick.\nWe finished off with the fried ice cream which was just like the shrimp, much too fried and difficult to eat. Our friends noted that the quality of food had definitely changed since their last visit.  The positive is that the wait staff were prompt and attentive.  The food wasn't horrible, just really underwhelming."
Four,"""We order the waffle dogs as seen on Food Network's \the best thing I've ever ate\"""" and it was not as delicious as we anticipated.  It was not as crispy as we would have liked. The waffle didn't appear to have been cooked to a nice crisp.\n\nWe also had the 1/2 order of Caramelized banana & pecan brioche French toast and that was amazing!\n\nThe best was the chicken fried steak.  OMG, it was SOOO good!  Nice and crispy on the outside and the sauce complimented the chicken fried steak very nicely.  I would highly recommend this dish.  I'll definitely be back for this dish."""""""
Five,"Before Cafe Bink the only reason I went to Carefree was to visit the Boulders Resort.    My only complaint about the resort was that there were a limited amount of great dining experiences within a stones throw, until Cafe Bink. \n\nThis is a must try if you are in the area.  Cafe Bink is a small restaurant and bar in the middle of strip mall.  The food that comes out of the kitchen is first class french bistro food taken up a notch.  The braised pork appetizer was to die for.  Juicy but not overly fatty with a maple glaze.  I had the crispy game hen which was their take on chicken and dumplings.  Perfectly done with a crisp exterior with a tender juicy interior.  My wife had their bolognese which was a kicked up bolognese sauce served with creamy polenta.  Also they we had a side of fries (their speciality) which came with all things truffled ketchup.  \n\nOVerall this is a great little oasis in the middle of the high dessert north of Scottsdale.  The portions are generous and the wait staff is knowledga\\ible, attentive and friendly.  The wine list is diverse with a lot of selections by the class.  Not just your chardonnay and cabernet line up!  I enjoyed an Argentine Pinot Noir from a vineyard that I never heard up.  It was marvelous. \n\nEnjoy."
Four,"As the saying goes, don't judge a book by its cover...we walked into this place having many stereotypes like oh man, its gonna be a dive bar or u know...we're gonna be the only asians eating at this place, but it was GREAT. The lady at the bar was extremely nice and she even cooked our wine burgers right in front of us! Might be a poor man's version of benihana but whatever! still worth it! Definitely worth going, we went there everyday for 2 weeks straight, the wine burgers are delicious, and surprisingly so are the chili dogs! and very economical too! Awesome place"
Two,"Fast, friendly service, but the food was kinda gross.  I ordered the classic cheeseburger with fries.  I washed my hands, grabbed a drink, sat down on the patio, and the food was served.  Quick.  I'm a burger lover and this was just terrible.  The meat was gray and tasteless.  And I only say this because, in attempt to taste my food, I had to use a napkin to wipe off the spooge of mayo that was drowning everything on it.  The veggies were also tasteless, but typical of what one comes to expect in American convenience food (except the pickle slices, which were probably the best thing overall).  The fries had the potential to be great, but they were overcooked, and just a bit too overfried to satisfy.  I really hate to waste food, especially on these rare occasions when I eat out, but I just couldn't finish it.  It was yucky.  I actually feel like I have a brick I need to puke up right now.  Sorry guys, but the service wasn't enough to make me wanna come back."
Three,"""Maybe it's an expectations problem.  I've found that I occasionally need to tell friends to STOP HYPING THAT MOVIE to me, ever since Pirates of the Caribbean got so overhyped for so long by my well-meaning friends (\Best movie ever!\"""" \""""I laughed, I cried, it changed my life!\"""" \""""I'm dumping my fiance in the hopes of getting Johnny Depp's attention!\"""") that I walked in expecting Citizen Kane.  Needless to say, it didn't work out that way.\n\nI may have made the same mistake after getting so psyched about the Yelp reviews for Mamma Mia.\n\nThe Good: The pizza here is EXTREMELY affordable.  Couple the killer lunch special ($4 for two massive slices of cheese pizza and a can of soda) with a Groupon ($20 for $10), and you create what scientists refer to as a value vortex - a deal so good it should not be able to exist stably in reality (much like antimatter).  In this case, I went with four friends, ordered five specials, paid with the Groupon, and we ended up stuffing ourselves with hot pizza and cold soda for a combined $10.  That. Is.  Awesome.\n\nThe Meh: The pizza just wasn't that flavorful.  The sauce and cheese were pretty ordinary.  It just wasn't as special as I expected.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I will be back (especially since I had the foresight to buy two Groupons).  I'm an absolute sucker for value and this is the best pizza deal around.

Two,"""We went here because of the great reviews, but it really was a disaster.  We wanted our son to get his hair just cleaned up -- he is a cutie pie with beautiful curls, but his hair is destroyed.  We made an appointment to clean it up but we are scared to go back.  His \bangs\"""" now go all the way around the left side of his head -- it's like a very weird layer, so that his curls now exist only on the bottom of his head and stick out like a clown.  The right side is fine, oddly enough, which actually makes the problem worse.  It's so sad.  I want to cry every time I look at him.  I've just spent the last 2 hours trying to find a different salon open on Sunday because we can't imagine the same person could make it better.  None of the people mentioned in the other reviews was the person that cut his hair, so I am sure that is the difference.  I'm giving two stars only because the woman was very nice and I feel bad that the cut is so bad.\n\nUpdate:  Though we do not plan to return to the salon, the owner, Tara, did contact us about this review and offered to correct the problem.

Two,"I was in the fitness industry for 4 years, when I left the industry I needed to find a gym to call home. I went to Mountanside and was very impressed. The lady that gave me the tour was wonderful and the facility speaks for itself.  So I joined! That's where the joy ended. The front desk staff is rude and standoffish! God forbid you need to buy a water or smoothie or something from the juice bar. They are so put out by it!! The kids club attendents for the most part were nice. In the exception of one, and she was extremely rude! The membership counslers look down their noses at you, unless they are trying to sell you a membership.

Two,"A signed picture of a smiling LaToya Jackson greets you as you enter. The staff is friendly, the restaurant is spacious, and more than 80 items are offered, dessert included. But the food is far from memorable. A lot of the items were bland - even my favorite, fried chicken - and those which were not were sub par even for a buffet. And don't bother with the sushi; I've come to the conclusion that if you don't have a sushi chef preparing the sushi behind a sushi counter, it's probably not worth it. The establishment will probably survive, though. It looks like it's been there forever and seems to have a loyal customer base from Sun City. The perpetual bumper-to-bumper traffic on that part of Grand Avenue on the drive back to Phoenix was a fitting conclusion for this buffet excursion."
Four,This place was really great and we will definitely be back. My wife and I went for dinner on a Thurs night and we loved the food and the overall experience. I had the rotisserie chicken and my wife had butternut squash enchiladas. We were both very happy with the main course but the funny thing was that we really loved the house salad and the Ceaser salad we got to start off. Strange but they were delicious.  The service was very good so no complaints there. Parking is tough but we found street parking\nThe prices were very fair and I had a beer and the wife had a mojito which was very good\nWe also had coffee after dinner and it was delish!
Two,"I had a date here last weekend. We ordered the green hummus, which was pretty good. I had the green burger which I thought was just ok, I've had much better veggie burgers before. My date (a vegetarian) had the pizza, which she didn't like at all, I think the mock cheese had something to do with it. \n\nThe location is in a strip mall, which wasn't that great, and the ambiance in the restaurant seemed very eclectic (not in a good way).  \n\nAll and all I'd say I much prefer other semi-vegetarian restaurants, such as Pita Jungle, over this place."
Four,"Homemade frozen margs from sorbet and fantastic food should be top on your list for Old Town Scottsdale. \n\nMeeting a lunch date I arrived early and enjoyed a Cabernet and raspberry frozen margarita. I was unsure about that but after a sample was offered, I was sold. Outstanding! There's a small patio in front but I'll pass in the heat and enjoy the great indoors. Spicy Spanish music filled the air and we ordered.\n\nStart with the fresh guacamole made table side to taste. I love it that way. The salsa was delicious as well. Requesting input from our very knowledgeable waiter, I went with his suggestion of a spicy brisket sandwich but warned it comes with slaw on top. I'm not afraid. Bring it on. Across the table a Chipotle Caesar was greatly enjoyed. \n\nWhile I was only there for lunch, I'll be sure to visit again for dinner. I have a feeling the nightlife at the bar is amazing."

Oh yea - and they are GOOD! \n\nThe Starbury line has shoes that look like sweet Nikes but cost $15.  My girlfriend is an athletic shoe snob that has fallen in love with these shoes.  Not only does it cheaply feed her \I must have a different pair of shoes to match every outfit\"""" fetish, but she has also found them to be just as if not more comfortable that brands where she's paid 4-10 times as much. And it doesn't stop there.  There are Starbury polo shirts that specifically match particular shoes.  And ya know how much?  $5.  On our last trip there were 2 shoes and 4 shirts purchased for the price she would have normally bought 1 pair of shoes.  She was in heaven.\n\nThe Venus line isn't out yet - but she recently signed to sell exclusively with them.

SJP's clothing line is totally unexpected in that it's cute, it's fun, it's fashionable and it's cheap.  I mean it.  With no sale going at all you're looking at  prices at or less than Target.  Denim skirts- $12.  Cute white button down shirts $9.  It was kinda insane. I kept looking for the candid camera to catch our shock.  Even the accessories were cute. \n\nBut I have to say, as awesome as these individual things are, the whole center of the store is a giant divider filled with cubbies of t-shirts.  From your favorite college sports teams to oh-my-god-they-did-not-just-say-that funny t-shirts.  On our first trip there we OD'd a bit here and got about 8-10 shirts.  But at 2 for $15, it's so hard to say no.\n\nThis is not a mall where you would expect for this to be located.   They are doing some kind of massive re-development over there which should help - but let's just say that this is no Scottsdale mall.  But I've gotta say, it's the only one in Arizona - and it's worth the drive.\n\nUPDATE: Channel 3's Good Morning AZ did a remote show from this mall today.  They did a quickie on Steve & Barry.

Five,"This place does exactly what it sets out to do which is to provide comfort food at a great price. Portions are huge. I had the beef stew served with a thick slick of buttery toast and it was outstanding. A big heap of mash potatoes in the middle of it. My son had the Tri Trip, which he gobbled up. The food arrived maybe 4 minutes after our order was placed. Very, very fast. This is great value if you like comfort food and a lot of it. Tried the desserts also and they were outstanding. We had a berry cobbler and a chocolate lava cake. Staff was friendly and efficient.\n\nExcellent. Fast service. Huge portions. Comfort food."
Five,"It wasn't too long ago that I was here eating a full meal with a few friends.\nI forgot what wine we had, but it was spectacular, and so was the cheese and fruit appetizer, salad, grilled fish with a sauce that was phenomenal,  roasted artichokes, and interesting dessert that was almost pudding like, but lightly and deliciously vanilla-ly. (see photos) I've heard that brunch is pretty great here too.\n\nWe sat on the patio, which was chill, spacious and gorgeous. If you looked around the buildings of the stores and other restaurants, you could see the view of the mountains and night sky. The tables are nicely spaced, so not everyone can hear your conversation.

Five,"Seriously...the best donut I've ever had.  Once you eat these, grocery store or Dunkin Donuts do not compare.  I have been a fan from their first store on Cave Creek and the same sweet owners have opened up this new store where the old Rubio's used to be.  I was craving a burrito and noticed the Rainbow Donuts sign and drove right in.  Their donuts are fresh, not heavy, big and melt in your mouth.  They do have a nice big menu for lunch and dinner and are open until 8pm!!  Donuts anytime.\n\nI'm so proud of them and that neighborhood just got a kick in the pants.  What a great addition!"

The interior is so fabulously \""""frontier\"""". Multiple big screen TVs play muted cable programs that are ignored by the patrons. It's like a bizarro sports bar. And I know bizarro.\n\nOne of the many reasons I prefer LGBT-bars to \""""straight bars\"""" is that every gay bar I've been to in this city, every drink I order, no matter how obscure and/or hard to memorize, is given to me enthusiastically. Sometimes it's outrageously expensive, especially if I'm not the gender of the bartender's preferred company.\n\n And sometimes I'm given the stink eye when I insist on being given the correct, IBA-sanctioned garnish with my drink. I'm just trying to get the most out of my PBSA education. Don't judge me.\n\nBut never once have I been told \""""you want a what? Are you gay?\"""" (River City) or \""""yeah, that's not going to happen\"""" (Tiki Lounge). Not even at Homme. \n\nAt Bunkhouse I asked for a Colorado Bulldog, and the bartender just nodded and made it happen for me, even though everybody around me all turned their heads and said \""""what the fuck is that?\"""" And it was delicious. So delicious that I overlooked the fact that it was not served to me in the bucket glass as deemed appropriate by the IBA. I think I officially need help.\n\nI'm sure there were plenty of fun-loving interesting people at Bunkhouse, but I didn't make any attempt to talk to any. I was too busy blowing all my quarters on the pool tables, pinball machines and electronic dart boards. Surprisingly, these attractions were unmanned during my entire visit to Bunkhouse, probably because, as mentioned before, people were too busy like, talking and socially interacting. \n\nMaking new friends? Fuck that, they have South Park pinball!\n\nAt first I was a little uncomfortable, being the only girl in the bar. But by the end of the night there were other girls, a lesbian couple, and even some drag queens from the show at Cruisin' 7th. And everyone was just as welcome as the bears and leather daddies. \n\nThe staff at Bunkhouse was really friendly, in that genuinely swishy way. (Oh noes, another strange and foreign word! I checked, wikipedia has an entry for this one too.) The staff at any bar really set the tone for the behavior of the patrons. The bartender could've given me that \""""what the fuck are you doing here\"""" look when I came up to order my drink, thus setting off the alert to the patrons that perhaps I didn't belong there and needed to be treated as such. \n\nBut they were really nice to me, got me anything I asked, and when the soda gun started pouring out syrup-less soda water, they dumped the glass out into the sink and made me a new drink rather than just passing me the diluted soda water and shrugging. I've had my heart broken by bartenders in the past, but I think Bunkhouse may be able to set me on the path to healing.\n\nOn Sundays they have $3 burgers and $1 drafts. And on Thursdays everyone runs around in their underwear, though now that the weather's getting cooler I don't see that happening so much. But I could be wrong.  You know, like I was about Homme and setting my nickname as \""""Transzilla\"""".\n\nNow I think about it, I'm wrong a lot of the time.\n\nBut that won't stop you from taking my suggestions, will it?"""""""
Four,"Wow!  I'm pretty impressed here.  First thing I notice about this place is that it looks like we're in China :)  Second, there is a  huge window in the back of the restaurant looking into the kitchen.  Yeah, this place makes their own noodles and the dude making it was pretty good and well skilled.  I always enjoy watching my food made from scratch; not to say it's scratch, but you get it....Prices are dirt cheap for what they're serving.  The food is good here and I can't say much more about it simply because I'm Chinese and it's Chinese food...eat it.  Service was good; poor waitress couldn't explain to me what Mae-Toh was, but thru some poor translation I declined to order it haha!  If it is what she said it is - I enjoy interesting food every now and then, but this time I gotta say no :)"
Three,"I got a coupon in the mail and put it on my breakfast list.  Recently they have redone the interior in a pleasant mix of browns and oranges, but they have 4 turquoise table tops?  They offer free wi-fi but you better have a charged battery as I only spotted a few booths that had an outlet handy,\n\nI had a Heritage combo of bacon, eggs, potatoes and pancakes.  It was cooked properly and quick.  I have visited 4 chain restaurants lately for an early Saturday morning breakfast.  This one was the best in service and quality/preparation of the food, well worth straying off of Bell Rd."
Four,"""*3.5 stars*\n\nIn the interest of supporting local AZ businesses, my husband and I had dinner here on my b-day (5/13). The first thing I observed is that they have a couple walk-up windows on the southside of the building so you can place your order and get food without having to go inside. Thought that was pretty clever! We arrived close to 8 pm and it was still pretty busy inside, but the line moved quickly. \n\nThe restaurant is set up cafeteria style with a kitschy country look. There is a huge mural on one wall dedicated to farm living and a John Deere tractor with accompanying bric-a-brac on the other side. Once we got through the line, I choose the meat plate with 2 sides...beef brisket and pulled pork for my meats, mac 'n' cheese and beans for my sides. I really wanted to get chicken instead of the pork, but they had unfortunately run out of chicken :( . My hubby got the full slab of pork ribs with sweet cut corn and mac 'n' cheese for his sides. We shared a piece of cornbread and for dessert, split the root beer cake. Happily I received a discount on my meal because it was my birthday (they advertise a \free\"""" meal, though it's basically $10 off).\n\nThe beef brisket and pulled pork were so good! Tender, juicy, and delicious! Those meats really are the best reason to go Joe's. The beans and mac 'n' cheese were just ok...so far Fleming's beats everyone hands down when it comes to mac 'n' cheese! The cornbread was so-so, tasted like it came from a box, but the honey butter that comes with it made it pretty tasty. Regrettably, my husband's pork ribs were pretty fatty as compared to Lucille's (Tempe Marketplace). The root beer cake was good, but not as delectable as we thought it would be. Maybe we were expecting too much after reading how much fellow Yelpers enjoyed it? Another thing worth mentioning (some others have commented on it too) is how strange the beverage station is. It's smack dab at the front of the line where you get your food so you have to fight your way through the crowd (if there is one) to get a refill. Weird.   \n\nTo conclude, Lucille's is still our #1 favorite place for BBQ, but we would still go to Joe's again."""""""
Three,"So now that I've been to Stacy's a few times, thought I'd review it. All in all, it's a great place. Seems to me a little on the pricey side BUT you also get a decent amount of food so it's a wash!!! Their BBQ items are wonderful and the barbecue sauce is out of this world! I was slightly disappointed on my last visit though. I decided to try the fish and all I can say is it IS a barbecue joint!! It was a bit over cooked and they were out of tarter sauce which is a huge bummer is you're ordering a fish & chips type deal and they were out. The girl behind the count was more than apologetic and offered me ranch instead, which much to my surprise, was alright! I will still HAPPILY continue to go to Stacy's keeping in mind to order the barbecue stuff! I was told the catfish was outstanding though!"
Four,"""I came here for the first time on a rainy Tuesday afternoon for lunch with a great friend I hadn't seen in 6 months.  Our server who was cute as a button picked up our \we are not in a hurry vibe\"""" right away.  We ordered a bottle of wine, fairly priced and loved the added touch of a chilled wine glass.  Our food was very good but no real risk was taken. We shared the fish and shrimp tacos which were flavorful but I had to add some hot sauce to give it a little bite.  The beans and white rice were a simple filler, nothing more.  The menu looked interesting and the prices were fair so I would definately try it again.\nThere were only 2 things that I found disapointing, first was after we ate I ordered a martini, one from their menu, it was fruity and you couldn't taste the alcohol at all.  The problem was it was served in a very small martini glass and I feel when you are going to make a fruity concoction and call in a martini the glass should be bigger, not the James Bond shaken not stirred size.\nSecond problem, as we were eating a woman came and sat at the table right by the restrooms and plugged her computer into an outlet that made the cord block the restroom door.  Now my companion and I couldn't decide if she worked there or not, she never ordered food and wasn't there long.  But just the fact that the cord blocked the door and could have been hazardous really bothered me.\nOverall though I give the place a B+"""""""
Four,I have been here twice now and both times ahve been great. The sushi has been fresh and tasty! The service was great both time as well. The price is a little high but on par with some of the other sushi locations around the valley. I thought they had a great selection of sushi and sashimi. The vegas roll and phili roll are both fantastic. The first time I went the person I was with didn't know much about sushi and the server took the time to explain and recommend some of the rolls which was very nice.
Two,"I guess I was expecting more. If you go to their website, you will get a site for Lenny's Burgers that is NOT associated with this location. So you may be misled. \n\nThis place is a small (seats 8 along the window) snack stand. Similar to the snack bars at sporting events. They had 2 picnic tables outside.The day we went there it was smokey from the exhaust fan not working well. It was hot and greasy and claustraphobic inside. In 2 seconds we agreed to make this a take out order. \n\nOn the plus side, the burgers were good but you have to pay for each topping except condiments, lettuce and tomato. The lettuce was sparcely distributed. My wife had a chicken salad that I could have made at home."
Three,"I like the Mesa and Tempe locations better, but this place suffices if I'm in Old Town Scottsdale and need a sushi fixin'. Service can be slow at times, but it's not all that bad. It's hard to get a table though, especially on weekends - even if you call ahead of time.\n\nAs for the sushi itself, like I've said with the other locations... it's not fantastic, but it's not horrible either. If that's not your thing, go with the teppanyaki, especially during happy hour (again, if you can get a table)."
Five,"""Don't let the suit's fool you...\n\nI don't hang out in Paradise Valley too much, however I went to meet with a local radio/writer celebrity at the local starbucks. As I pulled in to the parking lot I noticed Ambassador Fine Cigars. After the meeting I took a stroll on down to the store with my wonderful mocha. First saw dood in a suit smoking and I was like ok nice. Then old guy came with a suit and I was like oh damn these guys work here!!\n\nAfter all that noise, I was thinking what the hell did I walk into... the prices are going to be outrageous! I asked him where the Padron's were and he kindly showed me. This walk in humidor was like no other walk in humidor. HUGE, packed, humidity was great! \Just push on the door\"""" the kind gentleman said. I was expecting it to slide open automatically like home depot or something.\n\nWalk to the Cigars I was looking for, Padron 1926 #1 $20.70, Padron 1964 Imperial Maduro $14.70. (prices subject to change over time) These prices were about five dollars cheaper then other local cigars stores in Scottsdale. The other guy on the couch welcomed me back to smoke as the kind old man was telling me we sell all of our cigars at suggested manufacturers retail price. \n\nI will be going to this store again, saving money and smoking fine cigars from Ambassador!"""""""
Four,"Nothing new to add here. Their bread is awesome. He ended up getting the Mediterranean Style Mahi Mahi and I got the cheese quesadillas from the appetizer section with Shrimp and both dishes were awesome. Our little one also got the bread and bananas they bring out for children. This really helps a lot because they bring that small plate out for the kids right away so you don't end up getting a screaming devil at your table. \n\n Of course when you go the Cheesecake Factory, how can you NOT get a cheesecake slice for dessert. We ended up with the Godiva cheesecake and it was amazing. Extremely rich and extremely fattening but who cares!"
Three,"Sunday V-Day \n\nEmpty and boring. The service was oddly slow and odd in general. The waitress was overly nice and I swear she was Minnie Mouse @ Disney for a year or two. \n\nThe food was good but not great. Everyone liked what they had but no one had a overwhelming time. \n\nThe stadium was gross and ugly compared to the regular season vibrant green. It seemed a little sad. LOL\n\nAlthough I did not have anyone sitting with me while trying to eat, I did have a man cleaning his washcloths in the sink. He was clean and friendly but I thought it was funny."
Four,"Grab yourself a white hot, or whatever other flame broiled tube steak that does it for you, and have a seat.  Wait, get some fries or rings with that.\n\nLike a dinner and a show?  While you're waiting in line, you get to watch the grill masters at their culinary best.\n\nI thought Buffalo NY was known for chicken wings and grain elevators, but apparently they know a thing or two about serving up and incredible meat-by-product encased in sheepskin (actually, I think its the small intestine of sheep).  So far, I haven't gotten any dogs which are ribbed (for my or anyone else's pleasure).\n\nCome out and get a taste of Buffalo, because if you like hot dogs, then you'll love what Ted's has to offer.\n\n-Swoop"
Four,"I have been several times to The Coffee Shop and every time, it's a treat! Literally! The coffee is really great and the atmosphere is totally comfortable but to be blatantly honest, it's really all about those cupcakes. Holy amazing cakes, Batman! That's some serious greatness packed into that little bundle of dough and frosting.\n\nI hosted an event here not too long ago and it was so fun! The service was perfect, the atmosphere was awesome. It really set the stage for a great evening. We packed the inside out and just had an evening to remember. I suggest you do the same. Come, hang out, chill and soak up all that is The Coffee Shop. You will not be dissappointed."
Two,"First off, I came in expecting quite a bit from this place since I've been to the Scottsdale Quarter location as not only very impressed with the menu, but also with the service. This location definitely has the same name and menu but much different service.\n\nI was seated quickly and had my drink order taken. Then after about 10-15 minutes, I realize that we haven't seen our waitress forever. We flag down another waitress only to find out that she is our server now. We would easily go 10 minutes in between seeing her. Not like there was a shortage of workers considering there were almost as many waitresses as there were customers. After 15 minutes of waiting for my dessert, I flag the waitress down again and ask about my dessert only to find out she forgot. She just went and got it and went on with business like nothing happened. I was definitely getting the vibe that she wasn't interested in earning much in tips that night so I was happy to oblige her. We didn't even get acknowledged by her as we walked right past her when leaving. \n\nOnly reason this place doesn't get one star is because their happy hour menu is amazing. With that said....go to a different location!!! This place won't see any of my business ever again."
One,"Gay, gay, gay, oh and did I mention gay?  I really wish 0 stars was offered.  This place is terrible.  Pretentious people, over priced drinks, and a terrible vibe.  If you don't have money, you wont get anywhere in this place.  It's not fun and I will never go back.  The only thing that saves this place is the fact they serve booze.  I would never go to this place on my own, but I have been twice because of birthday parties and I had to get wasted just to deal with the crowd.  I don't want to write anymore because it's really pissing me off!!"
Three,"This place is decent.  I like the atmosphere OK, the wait staff is friendly enough, and the food is decent.  \n\nI've had a few different things off the menu and there was nothing was memorable other than the wings.  The wings are good, but not great.  They don't overcook them and they are a good size yet even with all the flavors they lack one that I HAVE to go back and eat.\n\nI also think they could add a couple more micro brews into their beer selection and considering they don't have happy hour, it isn't cheap to go for a round of beers and some wings."
Three,"The fresh rolls and sanwiches are worth 4 or 5 stars, the value is worth even more than that (the food is CHEAP!), the only thing holding this place back from a higher review is it's a total dump.  I'm OK with it not being flashy, in fact I think that's an ambiance all its own, but the place just doesn't feel very clean.   The bottles of sauce on the tables are always slimy from prior use, and I always feel like I should wash my hands after handling them.  But again, teh food?  You can get out of here at lunch with a belly full of delicious food for under $7.  Crazy!"
Four,"DANGEROUSLY located across the street from my old work, I hold Lenny's burger shop directly responsible for those 5 extra pounds I put on while working there. This place was great. Juicy delicious burgers and seasoned french fries were a staple at this joint, but you would be surprised what else they did well! My favorite was the country burger combo. Killer milkshakes too. And if you work in the area, they started serving breakfast a couple years ago and the breakfast burritos are solid. Conveniently located right next to the Thomas lightrail stop."
Two,"""The breakfast here was amazing - wonderful oatmeal with cherry brulee.  The breakfast buffet was also excellent.  However, I give this restaurant two stars because of the dinner we had the night prior to the great breakfast.  The signature lemon lavender martini was very disappointing, as they were fresh out of lavender so they brought me a basic lemon drop martini.  The waiter highly hyped the lemon chicken that came with the \best mashed potatoes he'd ever had\"""", so I ordered that.  The chicken (which was claimed to have been marinated in lemon all night long) had zero lemon taste to it.  Zero.  It was simple rotisserie chicken - good flavor but not what it claimed to me.  The mashed potatoes - I took one bite and without saying anything about them I had my fiance taste them.  His reaction was, \""""they taste like instant potatoes\"""", which was exactly my thought!!!!!!  I was stunned since they were so hyped.  If I stay at the Biltmore again I definitely would not eat dinner here - I would try the nicer restaurant on the property or go off property."""""""
Five,"""Ended up at the duce on NYE right before the ball dropped. They were serving hot cereal, Skillet scrambles, baked pancakes and hot coffee drinks along with all the other goodies they create in their 65' Airstream trailer turned kitchen and cocktails from behind the bar of what the owner told us used to service Chicagoans before, during and after prohibition. \n\nThis place is to cool for school.  Everybody that worked there was donned in pajamas, robes and slippers as were many of what appeared to be \duce regulars\"""".\n\n Food, cocktails, old school gym, amazing clothing store, ping pong, shuffle board and corn hole...or as they call it...\""""duce bag\"""". \n\nbest NYE ever!!!"""""""
Four,"The closest to Roscoe's that I've ever found. Yes, Roscoe's is better - but NOT BY MUCH. I think the waffles were a tad bit sweeter than Roscoe's (perhaps a bit too sweet for me?), but overall the combination is perfection! This will be very high on my list for my return visits to Phoenix. It's relatively close to the airport and worth the drive if you are on a layover. YUM. \n\nAs a side note, the beverage menu is pretty freaking hilarious as well. They serve HUGE jars of kool-aid (and I saw many people getting REFILLS of their 60+ ounce kool-aid). I guess the only thing better than a 2000 calorie breakfast is another 2000 calories of bright red artificial awesomeness to wash it down with :)"
Five,"I have only have one service at True Harmony, but I am definitely going back for more! I was having some severe sciatica on the left side of my lower back and leg that had been going on for weeks. A friend of mine suggested I go see one of their massage therapists since she was awesome. I booked my appt and went in. I CAN NOT remember her name.....sorry, but she was awesome! She took the time to ask about my pain and history, and what I have been doing to try to correct the problem. Then she suggested that I get a Cranial Sacral Massage. I loved it! Yes it did hurt a bit because I was already in pain, but she was able to give me additional mobility in my lower back and helped to reduce the pain I was in. She also gave me some tips for where to ice my back and for how long. The staff was very knowledgeable and helpful. I purchased a gift certificate for a different girlfriend who also has some back issues. She hasn't used it yet, but I'll report back when she does:) My next appt will be another massage and a facial! I'm so excited!!!!"
Five,"I went on a girls day out this last Saturday. We got there around 1, it was pretty dead, so we had the whole place to decide where to sit. It is quite a bit bigger than the University location (that is the only other location I have been to, and partly why this one is getting five stars). We took a few minutes to figure out what we were getting (well not me, I order the same thing every time, I need to venture out a little more, but I just love love love the masaman and Thai fried rice so much). My Sis got the masaman also, she is stuck on it like I am, and our friend got the sweet and sour. The food came out so fast, like five minutes! Of course my Sis and I loved it, we are Thai Basil fanatics. Our friend had never had Thai, but she said she really liked what she ordered. We indulged and got the sticky rice dessert, and I loved it. \n\nI am going with a five for a few reasons. First, this place impressed me more than the University location, which says a lot in my eyes because I love the University location a lot. The service there has always been amazing. The food was good 'ol Thai Basil, but something about it was just better. The cook must have just been better or something, cause it was just better for some reason. So as far as comparison, this location is great and gets a five! Also, this is coming from my narrow Thai food scope, but it is the best I have had. The only other Thai places I have eatin at are Line Thai and Siam Thai, both are great, but this Thai basil location is awesome!"
Five,"Ah, the Vermonter... a great combination: the apples, the cheddar, the cranberry mayo, the turkey and ham.\n\nThis place is hidden back from Via Linda and 90th and you may not see it when first checking out the shopping center... but if you like a good sandwich and you'd like to try something a little new, you ought to check it out.  Ingredients that aren't insanely crazy, but that are inventive and that fit together wonderfully into a good sandwich.\n\nTheir soups are delicious, and their wraps are very good.\n\nThe owners are pretty cool, too!\n\nI will be back, and this sandwich shop is definitely growing on me each time I visit.  Delicious food."
One,"I should have walked away from this place as soon as I started the check-in process. The guy at the front desk wasn't helpful... apparently no one was available to assist in carrying bags to the room and there were no baggage carts to help you make one trip to the room. \n\nThe room was the size of a bathroom. The walls are paper-thin and you're SOL if staying downstairs because everything creaks upstairs. \n\nYou'd be lucky if you receive more than a bar when connecting to wifi.\n\nThe only reason I'd give one star is because I forgot a couple personal items in the room and the head of housekeeping, Maria, was prompt in returning my call. She is putting my items to the side until I'm able to go back and pick them up, which is very sweet of her to do.\n\nThere are so many nice places to stay in Scottsdale... pick one and spare yourself."
Four,"I decided to stop in after getting my car washed at Costco.  They had a great lunch special: 1/2 salad, soup and drink for around $7.50.  I got my order to go and realized when I got to work that they forgot my salad dressing :-/.  The salad au natural was fresh..good quality ingredients...I'm sure it would have been even better with the dressing...I digress.  \nI had the Tuscan Soup and that was pretty good too.  I also appreciate friendly customer service.  \n\nSeeing as I'm trying to lose some lbs for summer and am in the area a lot.. I'm sure I will be back...next time I'll check the bag before I leave though :)"
Five,"Never been a huge Houston's guy. It's too dark, the menu is too limited, and while the food is good it somehow always fails to live up to the hype. Not bad, but not memorable, either.\n\nFrom what I understand, Hillstone is an amped-up Houston's, like a luxury badge on a Marriot hotel. Yawn. \n\nI tell you all this because heading into my first visit to Hillstone tonight I had zero expectations. None. Well, other than expecting to be underwhelmed.\n\nShame on me, because Hillstone hit a home run.\n\nA beautifully appointed, thoughtfully designed, approachably classy  indoor/outdoor dining venue, Hillstone offers the same dressed-down menu of a Houston's, but in a nicer setting with truly elite service.\n\nKaitlyn, our server, was attentive and exactly the right level of chipper. She was pleasing to both my 7-year-old niece as well as my 65-year-old mother. That's no easy feat. The burger was perfect, the beverages were never empty, the table was cleared on time, the check was dropped off and picked up seamlessly and the staff was always around but never a nuisance. \n\nAnd I love the setting. From the bar to the bathrooms everything just works. There are romantic corner booths and more lively center room talbes and the patio is gorgeous, with a perfect view of bustling Camelback Road. \n\nWhether it's a business meeting or a first date, Hillstone will definitely get my repeat business."
Two,"We decided to visit this place while in the area based on all of the strong reviews from our fellow Yelpers.  We went on a Sunday afternoon (right around 12pm) and had no issues with parking.  We scored a spot in front of the restaurant just as someone else was leaving.\n\nThe place was fairly busy and our party of two was immediately seated at a low table in the front (right by the acoustic musician).  Postino was well decorated and has a ton of seating options.  We wanted to fall in love with this place but just ended up liking it slightly. \n\nWe ordered the butchers block and the bruschetta plus cucumber lemonade and iced tea.\n\nWhile everything was okay, I wasn't knocked out of my socks.  My favorite part ended up being the butchers block rather than the bruschetta.  I think the issue that they have is that it is not crispy enough.  The bread was under-toasted and it made for a very chewy experience.  We ordered the Salmon pesto (the smoke flavor is weak and the pesto is strong so it misses there), Burratta, bacon, arugula and tomato (while our waitress claimed this to be her favorite, we were underwhelmed here too.  The bulk of the flavor came from the bacon and the arugula), tomato, basil and mozzarella (my favorite combo done wrong!  There was NO flavor to this and they should have at least provided an olive oil or balsamic drizzle to give it some pop.  The tomatoes weren't fully ripe either and were at the pink stage so they hadn't developed their true tenderness) and Prosciutto, fig and marscapone (by far our favorite since the flavor profile gave us a little bit of sweat, savory and salty).\n\nAll-in-all the place wasn't bad.  Based on the reviews though I just expected a wee bit more from my experience here.  I liked that they have live entertainment on the weekend although it makes it hard to hear when you are seated to close.\n\nI saw some folks sitting outside although I am not sure of how they survived in 110 degree weather.  On cooler nights though, I can see that being a nice place to hang.\n\nOh, I also didn't appreciate having to battle flies for my food.  They kept the door open which meant every critter wanted to beat the eat and join the tables. \n\nNot sure about returning as I've had this food concept before except with better execution."
Four,When I first moved to Arizona (11 years ago) I missed good Japanese food.  Little did I know that a few minutes from where I worked there was this little treasure.  It's great.  Over the years I've seen different owners come and go and the food somehow stays the same.  I suppose if it aint broke don't go f'ing around with it.  \n\nThe Yakisoba is good.  The combo chicken teriyaki with veggies is good.  A large is food enough for three people easily.  Unless you are completely famished.  The green tea they have makes you feel like you are cleaning out all the impurities from the weekend and putting something good in your body.  \n\nThey have a limited delivery zone and it has to be over $20.00.  Oh I almost forgot the potstickers are good too.  The dipping sauce is so simple and yet I have NEVER been able to duplicate it @ home.
One,"Staff was friendly and eager to please, despite some difficulty with communication across the language barrier. \n\nDrinking glasses had lip marks and flatware had fingerprints. My husband found a hair in his dinner. \n\nWe REALLY love Vietnamese food, and I particularly love finding a hidden gem of a restaurant. Unfortunately the lack of cleanliness and ambiance (not to mention the hair!) left me feeling nervous about the food quality and hesitant to complete my meal. What I did eat was mediocre."
Two,"16th Street Sports Bar should be a great place to have a drink. They have everything you would want in a sports bar: shuffle board, darts, pool, lots of TVs, and a little patio. Unfortunately, I have experienced terrible service there twice, and will not go back! Our first bad experience was during a Suns playoff game, and I think the waitress was new. The manager comped some of our food after we complained, and I appreciated that, so I gave them another chance. \n\nThe very next time I went to 16th street was a weekday night (10 pm on a Tuesday). It was slow so when we walked in I asked the bartender  what time they closed (2 am), and when last call would be (1:30). We went to play shuffleboard and had a few drinks. After a while the waitress came over and told us that it was last call. We thought we had 30 minutes, so we ordered a pitcher of Blue Moon to drink while we finished our game. Ten minutes later the bartender (obviously the woman in charge) came in and told us we had 5 minutes to finish a nearly full pitcher. 5 minutes later she told us we had to leave, and we left about half the pitcher there. When we got into our car we checked the clock: it was 12:30! The bartender obviously just wanted to get home and couldn't be bothered to let us, the customers, finish the beer we had paid for. It was apparent that she didn't care at all about the customers - she could have been very nice about the situation but she wasn't. She was pushy, and rude, and didn't care about the service she was providing. 16th street is very close to my house, and I wish it could be my neighborhood hang out, but I just can't get over the service, so I will never return."
Two,"""As an avid fan of Fez, I had been looking forward to trying their sister restaurant Switch. Drink specials were good for the downtown scene, but unfortunately that is where the compliments end.\n\nFor a $10 sandwich (with small side salad) I expect fresh and high quality ingredients. Instead the sandwiches my husband and I got seemed barely above par of Subway. My sandwich was the Murano Chicken which described chicken and prosciutto. The \chicken\"""" was a processed tasting lunch meat, not chicken breast. The aioli sauce was slathered on, almost as if to mask the rest of the sandwich, and the overly thick-cut under ripe tomato had to be picked off. The ciabatta bread also seemed fake and processed. Even the dressing on the Caesar side salad tasted weird...\n\nI am truly disappointed to find Switch's food barely above what you would find at a fast food establishment for much cheaper."""""""
One,"""I must be one of those \chumps\"""" because I just ate here 30 minutes ago and thought it was terrible. First off, the parking situation is ridiculous. I drive a long-bed crew cab truck so it's not like I ever expect it to be easy, but WTF? They have spaces facing a wall, which are easy to get to, but then have more spaces behind those for parallel parking and there isn't room for a go kart to back up when someone uses those other spaces. \n\nWhen you go inside it smells incredible, but when you get your food it just smells like pure butter. I am not even sure why I ate my dinner. It was a mix of ingredients that just didn't work. I had a carne asada burrito, probably not their specialty, but read enough of my reviews and you see thats almost all I eat. It was almost half beans, then a bunch of guacamole, and some very tasteless meat. It was a cardboard/bean/avocado burrito. The tortilla had so much damn butter on it that it tasted like a butter stick. I'm not looking forward to seeing my cardiologist report after this. \n\nProbably the one redeeming quality I see is the little 11 year old girl that was the cashier/order taker actually spoke english. The rest of the staff were not bi-lingual, and while they don't need to be, it seems funny that the entire menu is in English. I have no problem saying carne asada, but why type \""""grilled steak\"""" on the menu if you don't want me to order it that way?"""""""
Four,"Churn baby churn! Ice cream lovers, it is imperative you come try this place! Once you take your first lick, the rest is history! You'll immediately taste the trueness of the ingredient being used! Your taste bud will jump in rejoice! Promise!\n\nI tried the Peanut Butter, Toasted Coconut, and Madagascar Vanilla! You have the option to make it into a sandwich or a cone (waffle or pretzel).  Because I'm a sucker for trying new things, I opted for the pretzel! Bad idea! Clashed big time! It seemed like a good idea but failed! However, the sweetness and the saltiness did work, but as I crunched into the pretzel cone it tasted half stale and slightly buttery! That's just me!\n\nThe parking situation is very limited, so you might turn to Valet Parking.  The decor has that old school ice cream parlor feel but in an upscale kind of way.  Seating is scarce inside, but you can find more room in the back patio area.\n\nSeriously, come check it out and happy licking! =)"
One,"""This place = Failtown, USA.\n\nMy friends and I went in a while back to check out what all the hype was about this place.  Sure, it seemed like it was a Hooters knockoff (replace wings with burgers), but we had some hope that this establishment would be legit. WRONG.\n\nThe waitress informs one of my buddy's that if he finishes some sort of monster glutton burger then the meal was on the house.  Well sometime later, after putting that entire burger away, we get the check and notice the burger was still on the check.  We bring it up with the waitress who beats around the bush.  We then ask for the manager, who was VERY non-compliant.  After the discussion turns into an argument (wow real professional on your part Heart Attack Grill), he threatens to \call the cops if we don't leave and we better or else he's going to jump over the counter and punch us in the face.\""""\n\nSO MUCH FAIL\n\nRegardless of whether the food was good or not (nothing spectacular), I am NEVER going back there again nor would I recommend anyone else to do so.  There's a Red Robin a mile west on Warner that has a full bar and burgers just as gluttonous with unlimited steak fries to boot.  If I could give this place 0 stars (along with AIDS, Herpes, Cancer, and a slow fiery death), I would.\n\nDON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE"""""""
Three,"""Ate here last week and forgot to write a review. \n\nI went on a Wednesday during prime lunch hour so the place was busy but no wait. \n\nI went with 2 coworkers and we were quickly sat at a table. The waiter was friendly and gave his opinions on what we should get. Two of us got pizza and one of us got a burger. \n\nThe \Pepperoni\"""" pizza was great, it had two types of meat, jalapenos and had a great crisp to it. The pizza I got looked more like a salad then a pizza but after i removed the 12 pounds of arugula from the top I found my pizza and it was delicious. \n\nThe burger looked very good, but I didn't try any of it. He did comment that the bun was amazing and felt like it was baked fresh. He mentioned it was one of his top burgers in his mind. \n\nSo overall the food quality was top class. Why the 3 stars? The value for price. \n\n\nSo the pizza you get is about the same size as Pizzeria Bianco and runs about 14$ per pizza. That is a little high if you ask me. I mean the pizza is good, but not godlike. I can get same quality from NYPD or Mama Mia pizza for half the price, or twice as much for about the same price. \n\nI cant rate the burger value as I didn't taste it, but I think he said he would have it again. \n\nAnyway, I'm not telling people to stay away from this place as the food was very good....just know that you will pay for it through the nose."""""""
One,"""Tammie Coe's work looks incredible. I wish I could review it based on flavor, but I cannot. Here's why: My mother-in-law, thrilled at expecting her first grandchild, ordered Tammie Coe cakes for my baby shower. When she went to pick them up...WHOOPS!! Tammie Coe forgot to make them. 30 guests, catered lunch, no desserts. She ended up giving us pre-made cakes out of her freezers, and we forgave...after all, mistakes happen, right? Even to very high-end bakers with huge followings and even huger price tags....right? Fast forward a few years to my sister's bridal shower. Sister's having a destination wedding in Switzerland, in a castle in the Alps. Hostess throwing the shower wants to go along with the theme and have 30 individual Swedish \Princess Cakes\"""" for dessert, which happen to be a favorite of the bride. We search high and low all around Phoenix to find someone other than IKEA who makes these unusual cakes (IKEA's are frozen, and who's got freezer space for 30 cakes??). But guess who makes them to order? Tammie Coe!!! She even remembers us from the baby shower a few years prior, and has the good sense to redden in the face over that embarrassing memory. We all share a good laugh over silly mixups, place the order, and pay nearly $300 for it. Shower day comes, we go to pick them up, these delicious, bride-requested, dream-wedding themed 30 cakes, and....WHOOOOOPS!!!! Tammie Coe forgot to make them. AGAIN. Seriously???? Yes, seriously. At this point, either Tammie Coe has some weird passive aggressive objection to my family's happy occasions, or she just sucks and can't get her business together. Note to Tammie Coe: if you're going to make a habit of forgetting to make pricey, occasion-driven baked goods, DON'T DO IT TWICE TO THE SAME FAMILY. Or maybe this is just how she rolls, and forgetting to follow through with orders is a common theme? Either way, bad business model. Ta ta, Tammie Coe. Never, never, ever again."""""""

Five,"On the best days, you'll walk in to the smell of freshly roasting coffee beans, a special blend created by the ever-present owner, Steve Belt.

Four,"""Same Ownership, New Management\n-\n-\n-\n\nI wrote my first Van Buren (Flagship) Big Apple Yelp* almost two years ago.  I've eaten at Big Apples all over the valley since 1985.  Two years ago, The gilding was wearing off the lily.  That's an old saying the now-unknown song \For the Good Times\"""" put into words.\n\nAbout two percent of family owned American small businesses are held in founding family hands four or more generations.  In 2009 Sherry Cameron returned to Phoenix, the third generation of Bill Johnson's family to manage this valley chain.  \n\nSherry is making a positive difference.  Some Big Apple employees have worked for the place three or four decades, so the foundation of the Johnson legacy is very good.  And yes, the Big Apple is a cowboy kind of steak house/bar-b-que.  But it's got more than that on the menu.  \n\nLast night, after two deep-fried, bar-b-que sauced, onion ringed, cholesterol painted weeks in Merkel, TX I returned home.  (Electric Flag, \""""Just got in from Texas,\"""" inserted here, music, no vocals) My recent reviews have a few words about the Plains eateries I found in Merkel and Abilene.  Sweet D suggested we stop by the Big A, since it was on our way home.   HER family has eaten at Big A's since 1956.  \n\nThere's no way I was going to consume another plate of bar-b-que something after those weeks in Texas.  I had a southwest chicken salad.  It was very good.  \n\nThe Johnson family kept up the food traditions making them successful for many decades, somewhat oblivious to the changes in Phoenix food habits.   \n\nSherry Cameron's global food service and hospitality career is serving her well.  Logo and menu graphic updates don't impress me, but tuning time-tested recipes to 21st century tastes and health concerns does.  You can find a vegetarian dish or two in the menu, and Ralph, manager at Van Buren says they've switched to lettuce staying fresher, with a higher level of quality .  The grilled chicken in my salad was cooked perfectly with a nice flavor, the mix of flavors in the salad zesty on my palate, and my hot tea delivered really smart, with a full cup plus a pot of hot water.  I was a perfect conclusion to my trip.  I am giving up precious sleep writing this.  \n\nI suggest you give the Big Apple a chance.  Or if you've dissed it, another chance.  I look forward to the Bill Johnson legacy lasting several more generations, the classic western art neon steer sign on Van Buren getting a paint job and new tubes, the bar-b-que sculptures on the roof working again, next to the fiberglass Trigger.  It's cowboy kitsch and good old food in the age when mommas stopped letting their kids grow up to be cowboys.  \n\nFor me, Big Apple says, \""""Phoenix Arizona\"""" way more than the laser-guided UFO landing site that was Patriot's Park, Or the blue LED tornado near the ASU downtown campus.  It's not Kansas Toto, it's Phoenix Arizona.  And the Big Apple, under new management, is showing it's no newcomer just blowing through town.  They don't fool ya, they feed ya."""""""
Four,"""I moved from Tempe to North Phoenix a month ago.  Aside from access to light rail the one thing I had been missing most was access to great Mediterranean food.  I'm always game for a good kebab or falafel sandwich.  A coworker mentioned Saba's and I was there just a few days later.\n\nI stopped in after work and picked up dinner for me and the roommate.  The place was busy and almost filled to capacity.  Saba's is one of the places that lacks width but stretches back kind of far.  Looked a bit cramped but I can handle that style of seating for good food.  The waiters brought out plates of flaming dishes and yelled \OPAH!\"""" each time.  Not sure if anyone working there was actually Greek but it makes for a good show and adds some to the atmosphere of the place.  My order for two was ready to go in about 5 minutes (not too fast or slow).  I was out the door and headed to home with the fantastic aroma of sheesh kebab sandwich filing my auto.\n\nMy roommate had the Rolled Baba sandwich, a veggie dish made with baba ghannouj.  She liked it a lot but I didn't try it so I'll take her word for it.\n\nI had the lamb sheesh pita.  It was served with an ample portion of delicious meat and they were generous with the veggie toppings and yogurt sauce.  Fantastic sandwich.\n\nThe menu has a fine selection sides, salads, burgers, sandwiches and entrees.  They serve Greek beer and I think they have one from the Middle East as well.  One day, sooner than later, I'll venture back and dine in (even if it's a bit crowded) and take in the atmosphere and a great meal.\n\nSaba's was very impressive all around.  It's on par with my two favorite locations in Tempe.  This place will be getting a lot of my eating out money.  If it wasn't for other favorite kebab locations in New York City, Philadelphia and Toronto that were a tad better I likely would have given Saba's a solid 5 stars.  It was that good.  Can't wait to go back."""""""

Five,"Is there anything that the LGO Hospitality Group touches that isn't fabulous? I have yet to find it.\n\nI am embarrassed to say that last night was the first time I have been to the Pizzeria. Between lunch and dinner, I frequent the LGO market at least two or three times a week; and I know most of the crew at Postino - yet, I've never ventured into their world of pizza. That is, until last night.\n\nWe arrived around 5:45 and ordered a glass of the Rosso and Sangiovese and mulled over the menu. Because we weren't too terribly hungry we debated between the Gladiator and the Roasted Corn Pizza. When our server, Chris, overheard us, he told us they would gladly do half and half so that we can taste both. I was thrilled. When the pizzas came out they were great. The Gladiator is your more traditional style pizza and the Roasted Corn had such an refreshing unique merriment of flavors. \n\nWe finished by sharing a piece of the Red Velvet Cake. Seriously? I could have had another piece all by myself. Its six or seven thin layers of cake, moist and delicious, separated by an addicting cream cheese frosting that I kept looking for more of. \n\nAs we were getting ready to leave; I was admiring the pies that were on the table next to us. I was offered a piece of the Avocado Pizza. I never would have ordered it, and at first I declined, but she insisted, I was curious and I caved. Again, it was pretty good. Not sure I would eat a whole Avocado Pizza - but I loved the taster.\n\nRumor has it that the wings are pretty good...I have no reason to doubt that its true.

We waited almost 40 minutes for one gyro plate and one souvlaki plate although they did bring out soup samples to all the tables which was very thoughtful.  The gyro was nothing to write home about, the meat on the top of the pita was very very crispy, crunchy in fact which oddly enough, added a pleasant texture.  The sauce was standard and was just the right amount.  The rice was a STANDOUT....super fluffy but in need of a little more seasoning.  My husband's souvlaki pita was tasty, the meat was lean, moist and cut in perfect sizes for the wrap.  Fries were standard with a slight sprinkle of parmesan and parsley.\n\nDeco was a little weird...........a map of Manzanillo Mexico in a Greek place was a little weird not to mention the Asian/Chinese art on the tables.  Television was quite loud and obtrusive, maybe a little mood music would be a better choice at night.

I considered giving them an extra star because there's a dude named Yoder that works there who I pretend is a Zen like sandwich master from the Dagobah system who holds the secret recipe to the delicious slaw they put on the Gruben.  \n\nIt's a bit of a cluster-F at the drink/napkin area...too tight in there for people but the fact that they have Diet Dr. P in the fountain makes up for it.  Like Nicole T, I'm a sucker for the DDP."""""""

Three,"3 stars - Yelp says - A OK\n\nThat means, sure, I'd go back and I should state here and now that the 3 stars might not be all their fault but my fault too.\n\nPlan to see mid-week movie with my daughter who teaches at junior high school and after school volleyball and we have plans for 7:45 movie which means time is compressed. Daughter has limited sense of adventure for foods so I figure this place always offers her bail-out choice of Italian. Enough background...\n\nProblem is, I had lunch too late and I arrived less than hungry. I'm equivocal what to order. I ask waiter for advice (mistake). I order cream soda and he comes back and asks me what flavor and listing too many choices. I order cherry and it seems to be a club soda with grenadiene (sp?) - mistake.\n\nOrders arrive - daughter shocks me by ordering Pad Thai which was quite good. I get winter special of Ishikari - Salmon, cabbage, tofu and rice noodles rather cleverly cooked in a miso based soup in industrial type mini-bucket with oak sealing lid and apparently brought to table from oven. The salmon infusion into the miso was an incredibly delightful broth. The salmon appeared to be generous, good quality but a bit undercooked and I didn't have the time window to do anything about it. The rest...the tofu / cabbage / etc. seemed to derive no benefit from the delightful miso broth.\n\nSo in the end...I probably could have given them 4 stars because there is nothing inherently wrong with CherryBlossom Noodle Cafe. The waiter wasn't all that helpful but he was available at the most important times and we managed to get orders, served and check paid in time for movie which by other reviews worried me because of our narrow time window and the fact that this place is indeed busy.\n\nI would definitely return a much wiser person and next time, I go with my gut instinct and order the Champon as I had intended to the first time."
One,"Yep Yelpers - I'm not ever going back here again. \n\nI asked the girl at the counter if they had Iced Toddy. Nope...no big deal. I asked instead for iced coffee with two shots of espresso in it. She said sure, no problem. \n\nWhat she handed me was A CUP OF ICE with two BITTER, BITTER, BITTER shots of espresso in the bottom. (That's not me being hyperbolic. I came home and made everyone in the house try the most bitter coffee concoction I've ever come across.) Okay so then she sent me over to the bar to the hot coffee. Melted my ice and my plastic cup. Not exactly what I meant when I asked if they had iced coffee... \n\nHow much did this crud cost me?? A whooping $2.75. Oh, but wait! It's actually $3.00, an extra 25 cents for running it on my card, which she tells me AS SHE SWIPES MY CARD. I had cash on me. And I really would have preferred to be offered a choice to use it ahead of time. \n\nAlso, their seating consists mostly of a long bar against the wall opposite of the coffee counter. You wouldn't be able to camp out here with a laptop, homework, or even a book. There just isn't any room. There's a few tables, but if a group walked in you'd have a major guilt trip. \n\nAll in all, you'd go to Hava Java for a run and go coffee. And frankly, I never want to put that stuff in my mouth again. I don't see what this place has to offer."
Four,"""Went there yesterday with a group of 9.  First of all, the staff were great - even though the restaurant is self-server, they served us because we were a large group. Amongst our group we had chicken, brisket, ribs and sliders (plus sides).  Our only complaint is with the ribs - while advertised as \baby back pork ribs\"""", they are large in size, and not as tender as we would have liked.  They were flavourful. Everything else was good. Portions are large, and we thought the prices were reasonable for what they served.  They don't really have any dessert to speak of - they should add some BBQ classics like pie, fruit crisps and ice cream."""""""
Three,"Hey, it's a Goodwill. Eclectic assortment of stuff that someone else doesn't want anymore, but is just what you are looking for. I have shopped here many times and don't always find something, but once and while I do find a gem. This is the first place I look for stuff to make kid's costumes. There is usually enough fake fur clothing to whip together some animal costume to the liking of small children.\nI usually use this Goodwill to drop off my stuff when its time to de-clutter. Last week I dropped off a working coffee maker because I got a new thermal coffee maker for Mother's day. The employees are always friendly here and the parking is easy and close to the door."
Four,"I really enjoyed my meal here.  It doesn't seem like they care about whether or not you're impressed, but they're confident you'll enjoy your experience.  A friend, who is a regular, brought me.  Obviously, as an out-of-towner, I never would have found this place on my own.  It's not a place you simply stumble across.  \nIt's definitely not inexpensive, but I wouldn't say it's outrageously priced.  You get what you pay for: fine food, prepared well, served in a pretty cool space.  \nIt's New Mexican cuisine.  I'm not sure what, exactly, that means, but there were a lot of chillies and tortillas.  \nThere's not a whole lot of seating, so you may or may not get seated right away.  And I think they discourage bringing children, although I don't think they're necessarily unwelcome.  \nAlso, I guess they have excellent breakfast, although I ate dinner when I went."
One,"Bought the Brazillian blowout on Groupon.  It was advertised to make curly hair straight for 6 weeks minimum even after washing. It took almost 4 hours to do my hair. It also was supposed to include a cut. The cut was uneven and terrible. My hair was straight, but kind of fuzzy on the ends. My mom finished the ends later with a flat iron and it looked good. I waited 3 days to rinse, not wash it as I was told. It went all the way back to as curly as it was to begin with. Called Cathee and she said she had a better product and it would be in in a few weeks. This was June. Finally in Sept. got a new appointment. On my way to my 1:00 appt. she called me to ask where I was. She said she changed it to noon per my request. I had requested to change it but she left me a message saying no she wanted to leave it at 1. She repeated 1:00 at least 6 times in the message. She said she never said that and I had to miss my appointment because she scheduled another at 3 and would not have time for me. She also was short and rude with me. She called back later after I played her message back into her own message as she would not answer her phone. She then asked if I wanted to reschedule?? I had to take the day off of work twice and still have curly hair and am out $150. I will be requesting a refund from Groupon and start a dispute with my credit card company. She did not handle the professionally at all in my opinion and I will not be returning or recommending her to anyone."
Two,"I feel I'm actually being generous giving 2 stars here.  The service was pretty good.  The TV's worked well...\n\nI ordered the mushroom swiss sliders.  If I hadn't been in a bit of a hurry I would have sent them back.  Tough, leathery, waaay overdone little meat patties.  They stopped just short of charcoal.  I ate 1 1/2 of them, my dog will get the rest.\n\nMy wife and daughter both got the regular burgers and felt 2 stars was in order for theirs as well.\n\nJust because it's a sports bar it's not ok to serve bad food ya know..."
Four,"I used to go to the Sportsman's on Camelback quite a bit, so I'd been meaning to go to this one which I live much closer to.\nFinally made it the other night.\nSame great wine selection, same great light meals, especially their cheese selection (I LOVE cheese!), including a fantastic grilled cheese sandwich, knowledgeable staff, and even a free internet hotspot.\nThe only problem? It's all hard surfaces, and the reverberation is TERRIBLE.  The sound of a party of 6 all moving their chairs to leave at the same time made me hold my ears & grit my teeth. It was exactly like the proverbial chalk on the blackboard.\n I was in a group of people, and I could not hear the person 2 seats down from me, with all the voices were bouncing around it was one huge din.\nI really want to get back there soon, but not at a time when they will be busy.\nPS - I would really give this place a 4-1/2 if I could."
Four,"Giligans Bar is the spot you want to visit when you feel like partying in Old Town, but lay low at the same time. Girls, no need to break out the 5-inch heels or spend an hour getting ready to come here. Feel free to come COMFY. \nGiligans possesses all the benefits of a good dive, like cheaper booze, (in big bottles), comfortable atmosphere, jello shots, games, karaoke, beer pong, a midget bar, lots of funny drink specials(for cougars and people with a breathalyzer in their car)  and an interesting crowd, but it's not a scary dive like the ones filled with Hells Angel bikers. Good happy hour specials too- lots of munches for 3 dollar which include taquitos, fried pizza rolls, and fried zucchini. \n\nTip- don't drink & drive!"
Three,"Three and a half stars.\nIt was a nice, clean, comfortable place to stay.  Nothing fancy and price was reasonable. \n\nStayed for two nights during Christmas Weekend with parents.  The staff I interacted with were all friendly. The Room was clean but the pillows and bed were little too soft for my taste. Free wi-fi, in room mini fridge, microwave and coffeemaker.  They offer breakfast till 10am, with both hot and cold choices. They also Proudly brew Starbucks coffee.   We did not go to the social hours in the early evening, but that's free too.  It was located close to 51 freeway on/off ramp. \n\nThe room had a weird smell when we first walked in but went away after we turned the air on for a bit.   The in-room air conditioner could be a little loud for some, but we were fine with it.   The housekeeping staff misunderstood us and did not service our room at all.  It was okay since we did not make a big mess, just wanted paper cups to be replenished and trash removed."
Four,"We went there one week ago, the place was packed, I'm sure because they just received an award from Food Network. We didn't wait too much, after 20 min we had our table. We order procciuto and asiago cheese as appetizers, they come with some bread and some dip, it was good. For dinner we ordered the pizza w/ sausage and sage I don't remember the name, it was pretty good. The food came quick, the staff was friendly. Highly recommended."
Five,"""OMG. If you want a taste of Latin heaven, you must try Deseo at the Westin Kierland Resort and Spa. I was whisked away to this beautiful restaurant by the BF (who works at the Westin), under the impression of having \a drink or two\"""". And boy did we. The mojitos our mixologist created for us were simply to die for, and I would be hard pressed to state my favorite. The Mango Mojito, The Strawberry Mojito, and even their standard were all amazing (and I tried them ALL). \n\nBut on top of their delicious mojito selection, the food was simply the best. Our waitress (tipped off by the BF to just bring us her favorites), first brought out the Lobster Civiche with avocado tempura in a sweet/spicy sauce. Words cannot express the deliciousness or quality of this meal. The lobster was cooked perfectly, the avocado tempura was a perfect accent, and I couldn't get enough of the sauce - we asked for more bread just to mop it all up. My mouth is literally watering right now just remembering this dish. \n\nNext up, another civiche with fresh ahi tuna, salmon, and whitefish, mixed with cilantro and jalapenos. Again, simply divine. The fish melted in my mouth. \n\nAfter both of these, we tried the popcorn curried shrimp, the tender flank steak, and the millionaire tiny tuna tacos. ALL were of the freshest quality and the most distinct flavors imaginable. \n\nFinally, our waitress brought out the dessert - a chocolate cigar with cappuccino mousse and candy matches. It was a masterpiece in and of itself. \n\nMy only comment after this amazing meal would be this - All of the food was amazing, but I probably shouldn't have started with the Lobster Civiche. I prefer to save the best for last!"""""""
Three,"Just kind of there with nothing special about this convention center. And the Phoenix downtown area is pretty boring and sparse except for the baseball stadium right next to it with some cool bars and restaurants. When there isn't a game, this area seems pretty dead.\n\nBottom line: Ho hum. Baseball stadium nearby is great entertainment option but can be a pain with all the traffic if you are trying to get out of the convention center area in the evening."
Five,"I loooove this restaurant. Everything is wonderful. The service is fantastic and all the waiters are very nice, the ambiance is intimate, classy, and romantic, and the food is delicious. The creme brulee dessert is a must-try and comes as a plate of creme brulee with a cookie gondola with chocolate and berries. Plenty of good wines available, too. And, as an added perk, you get a free gondola ride pass if you have dinner here. There is a lagoon behind the hotel where gondoliers will row you around and sing to you. Magical experience. :)"
Three,"""3 1/2 stars for Thai house. \n\nDon't get me wrong, their food is amazing, and their curries are pretty close to unique Thai. And I love them spicy. However, when upon ordering you're asked how hot you want your curry (on a scale of 1 being the lowest and 5 being the hottest), it usually never comes out the way you except it. \n\nLike I said, their curries are amazing. I've had the red, yellow, and green curries and they've never disappointed. Green is probably my favorite between them all. \n\nThey also have a vegetable house soup which is absolutely delicious, light, and flavorful. I would recommend it.\n\nHowever, one time I ordered the curry noodles. The noodles were so overcooked that they pretty much congealed together and it was near impossible to pick them up, let alone distinguish noodle to noodle when it came to eating the \paste\""""\n\nAlso their service is somewhat snooty and rude, and doesn't pay much attention to you or your questions."""""""
One,"How Horrible can it be.....Well let me tell you.  The food was uneatable and that is putting it nicely.  It started with no appetizers, we were told  they were served before we got there. We were in line when the door opened, so I guess  you had to be REALLY early! The chicken entree was so dried out you had to tear it apart as you could not cut it and then you  could not eat it. The asparagus (3 spears) were boiled to death (maybe this was the murder and where the detective was needed), the twice baked potato had been baked and baked and baked and then reheated until it was shoe leather. The carrot cake dessert was dry and by then we were just tired of the whole thing.  The acting was something my 5 and 6 year old grandchildren could do impromptu and lacked sooooo much to be desired.  It truly was an evening to be remembered.......... REMEMBER YOU DO NOT WANT TO DO THIS EVER AGAIN!"
One,"I actually visited this place twice in one day.  Both were fairly bad experiences.  The first time, the bar was empty so I sat by a table and it took a good while before I got a menu, or was asked what I wanted.  It also took awhile to just get a beer.  I ordered a simple meal and one beer and still didn't get to leave for over an hour!  I had to go to the bartender b/c the waiter was nowhere to be found and the manager had to cash me out.  I came back later that day, and literally stood in a packed bar for over 1 1/2 hours.  After being told by the hostess that a waitress is serving the area, I never once was offered a beer or anything to drink.  The waitress in the area just ignored me.  Their service is the worst i've ever seen in my entire life.  Blue 32 in Hermosa is much better.  I will never go to this bar again nor will I endorse it for anyone.  It's the worst bar in scottsdale as far as I'm concerned."
Four,"O Boy, why is it when I think i can slip in for 1 particular book, I am in here for over an hour, and find it hard to leave?  \n\nStore Lay-Out is inviting & sections are easily found.  Lots of space between isles.  It's usually quite easy to track down a store clerk for help and inquires.\n\nO, and if u sign up with there email, you get coupons on a regular basis - which reminds me: today I have a coupon for 40% off any item in the store - now, how cool is that?  Off to go use it!"
One,"All I can say is, um no thank you...this place is completely awful. And, I have not, nor will I EVER attempt to sell anything here.  I remember being a huge BE fan when it first opened in the SF Bay Area in about 1990.  I was a starving community college student and would be ecstatic at the overstuffed bag of  cute, stylish clothes that I could purchase for less than $30 bucks.  \n\nHow times have changed.  I can't believe they are actually selling used crap like this for $15-25 a piece, and previously worn shoes generally turn me off unless they're in excellent shape with an equally awesome price.  But, $26.50 for some nasty old Target clod hopppers, WTH???  This place makes My Sister's Closet look like Neiman Marcus!!!"
Four,"Apparently all the people in my department used to go to this place all of the time a couple of years ago. I'm new around here but I got a recommendation from a colleague to try it out, although I was concerned with the average ratings it had received. \n\nThe slight hipster artsy feel of the employees and decor made me feel rather comfortable there. The sandwich was good, a little bit too much mayo for my diet, but I suppose it's not Sacks' fault that I eat out too much... or is it?"
Three,"Haus Murphy's is fun place place to go for German meals and it has a lot of fans.  I found them to be a little dated with their decor and their food is usually cooked well done or over cooked.  Their service is A~OK.\n\nFood feedback:\nApps ~ \nSausage Sampler, Bratwurst/Krakauerwurst served over a bed of homemade Sauerkraut is tasty! \nPotato Cakes,  served with a side of Apple Sauce and sour cream was a bit overcooked very dry. \nThe Giant Bavarian Pretzel Imported 10oz. salted Pretzel is highly over rated and was not cooked evenly. \n\nMeals ~ \nTheir beef & pork sausages are all served over their homemade sauerkraut with German potato Salad or fries.\nBier Bratwurst - Beef-Pork Sausage is good.\nGerman Bratwurst - Pork Sausage is bland.\nKrakauer Wurst - Polish spicy Beef-Pork Sausage is awesome! \n\nTheir Schnitzel's are good but again overcooked at times. I preferred their Steak Schnitzel topped with a Gorgonzola cheese and Roasted Onion Sauce.  Served with German Fried Potatoes and Bacon Roasted Green Beans. \n\nBeers~\nSpaten Lager or Weihenstephan Hefeweizen are best, you cant go wrong here."
Two,"This is the worst of the Yardhouse locations in Phoenix.  The parking is a royal pain, there's often a wait, and this place gets annoyingly loud during popular sporting events.  Somehow this semi-yuppified place manages to attract all of the thugs who would normally go to a sleezy sports bar and scream at the TV there when their team is losing.  This Yardhouse is in a shopping mall, please go somewhere else.\n\nService & food quality are the same as the other Yardhouse locations in the valley.  Beer selection is great but not so great.  If you're a beer enthusiast, you've already tried at least 90% of the beers.  If you're not a beer enthusiast, you probably won't care that there's so many beers to choose from.  I think they missed the mark by having tons of widely available beers at one place rather than having a lot of hard to find beers that people will like to try for the first time.\n\nPrices are too high - $6 pints, $10 for most appetizers, and again - this location is bad for parking and customers."
Five,"This man can do amazing things with his hands if you know what I mean ;-) He was a fantastic entertainer and balloon maker at the Yelp Pleydate event at the Phoenix Children's museum last night. \n\nWe laughed our rear ends off he was so amusing and he made some fantastic pieces. He's able to come up with great ideas for both children and adult themed items, He made everything anyone requested last night. He even fulfilled our request for the dirtiest balloon creature of the night. He did not disappoint!\n\nHire this man."
Two,"""Been to this location twice, and both times have been extremely disappointed with the service (The food was decent).\n\nThe most recent time went for breakfast.  Only one person working the cash registered and the line was long.  That took about 10 minutes.  After waiting 10 minutes for food (omelet), a staff person stopped by to ask what we had ordered.  Told them and they disappeared.  After waiting another 5 minutes (15 since ordering),  I went to check on the food.  I was told that they had \screwed it up\"""" and that it was on it's way.  At the 20 minute mark, our food arrived.  The person bringing it to the table said sorry for the delay, but it wasn't sincere.  Food quality was OK.\n\nWhen I got home, I filled out the survey on the receipt stating pretty much the same as here.  The following Monday I did get a call from the manager and he said that they've been having some \""""issues.\""""  He said he would send some coupons for my trouble.  It's been a week and nothing has arrived, most likely I'd use them at a different location anyway.\n\nBy The Way....Paradise used to proudly proclaim that they made the bread fresh daily at the locations.  This is no longer the case (Actually I don't think it was ever the case)."""""""
Five,"""There's a reason there's a banner that reads,' Food Network Challenge Winner', hanging in their farmer market booth.

Four,"This little Mexican eatery is tucked away in a strip mall.  I only stumbled upon it by having to go to Albertsons.\n\nI wasn't terribly hungry but I can never pass up a taco joint.  The interior was decorated nice and authentic.  They even had futbol playing on a TV which several of the patrons (including myself) were excited about.  I opted for one taco, the Carne Asada Supreme Soft Taco.  The meat was perfectly seasoned and juicy.  Loaded with cheese, lettuce, tomato and sour cream.  I topped this bad boy with their homemade hot sauce which was muy bien!  I washed it all down with an ice cold lime Jarritos on the front patio.\n\nWas definitely a good choice to stop in.  I may be back tomorrow for a burrito!"
Three,"This Starbuck's is located in a little stip mall smashed between Zoe's Kitchen and an Einstein's bagels.  I come here in the morning on the way into work because its close to my job and its good reliable coffee.\n\nI've been going to Starbucks for years, and I'm starting to become a regular here.  It's not my favorite one, for a variety of different reasons.  First, seating here is awkward.  Inside, they have one really long table, a couch, and like 2 small tables.  More of a group oriented seating arrangement then bunches of individual tables.  They do have ample outdoor seating, but I don't always feel like sitting outside.\n\nThe service here is fine, but nothing exceptional.  I'm not moved by it, especially since I'm here in a very regular basis.  The staff is nice, but not as nice as others I have been to.\n\nMy only formal complaint is that half the time I go in here, thier out of half and half.  At 7AM.  I get tired of having to walk the container back and forth to the counter at least 1 day a week, usually more.  I know the baristas are busy, but there's nothing worse then waiting in line twice.  Once for your coffee order and another time while the barista finishes waiting on 3 other customers before he can get to the empty creamer.\n\nI mean, I do have good days in here, but its always the same 2 or 3 issues that they fail on when I'm in here.  Generic service, running out of essential supplies, and limited seating indoors.  I mean, I know seating is seating, but it gets frustrating sometimes when I want to sit down at 7AM to eat my muffin and Ive got to tough it out in the summer when its scortching hot and I'd rather be in the AC...\n\nI guess I've had better experiences at Starbucks throughout the valley that I can say these things as comparisons to this location."
Four,"We Frequent here about every two weeks. They have a great Happy Hour. The Wait Staff is Nice and helpful. It's always very clean which I LOVE. I really like the Filet Mignon Salad, Rice Noodles (Vermicelli) with Chicken, All their spring rolls are delicious and I usually have a Ginger Fizz..as far as cocktails go it's my favorite.We also like their Pho but it's been to hot lately to enjoy it. Sunday's are great to visit this place as it's usually not busy between 3-5. We've been on a Friday night and it's just really busy and loud. But if that's something your ok with enjoy!"
Two,"POSITIVES:\n+ Its a busy airport but its pretty efficient with checkins and security.  \n+ Lots of official workers around to ask for help if you're lost\n\nNEGATIVES:\n- Starbucks is located OUTSIDE security gate so you kind of have to gulp up your drinks before going through TSA....THIS IS A MAJOR NEGATIVE since I normally like to enjoy my drink while waiting to board.\n- The whole north, east, south, west sides of the airport confuse me when I have to catch a shuttle\n-  Separate terminals for groups of airlines makes its hard to walk over to the next terminal if you're in the wrong one"
Four,"""On a recent Dodger's road trip over Labor Day weekend, I was truly disappointed because nearly every restaurant I wanted to try was closed. Every recommendation I got, no joy. So thanks to Yelp, found this spot a few miles outside of downtown Phoenix. \n\nAppearance isn't everything, this looks just like a normal fast food type of place, but by checking the menu, found that there are several specialties that are my joys...After asking the cashier what's good, she responded, \We're known for our cheeseteaks.\"""" So I look and see that they serve it with whiz, which is the legit version of the Philly. Also noticed they had burgers, hot wings, and pizza. My 4 basic food groups, with the 5th being Mexican food. I ordered a burger and wings combo, that's right...both together in a combo, not burger and fries, burger and hot wings. Burger was good because of the bakery bun, not just a typical white bun. it was topped with fresh leaf lettuce, not iceberg, and red onions. I got the hot level wings which were not too spicy and tasted great. A friend ordered the cheesesteak so after seeing it, I ordered one for the road.\n\nAll in all, it isn't much to look at, but the food is definitely above average. All those specialties together also give it some extra points. For the M v. F followers, they do have a hot wings challenge, 10 Suicide wings in 1 hour. You get your name and picture on the wall of fame if accomplished. So again, plus points for the food challenge. I would definitely go back to this place on labor day since every other restaurant in Phoenix closes."""""""
Two,"""The service was unfriendly and the owner acted like he was doing me a FAVOR by re-filling my tiny salsa cup \(I'll do it for you this time; next time there will be a charge.\"""")  Wha???

I had a veggie burro and hubby had cheese enchiladas.  Those were both good, but not great. WAY too pricy for what you actually get, for sure.\n\nGood Mexican?  Los Dos Molinos is a much better bet!"""""""
Four,"Good bar food.  We ordered lots.  Sliders were hamd made patties on nice buns, tuna sliders were blackened and tasty, I got nothing bad to say about the chicken wings, and that's saying something, steak skewers were a bit dry, avodado dip was ok.  beer was ... well ... beer.  Right in the middle of a stretch of college hangouts, this one was a bit more upscale.  Plenty of people without being oppressive.  Gotta valet around back or park far away."
Two,"As the public house cornerstone of the country's dullest downtown, it does not surprise me that Cooper'stown is as inert as a Swiss nationalist.  What is confounding is that the shock-rock nature of the bar's namesake allowed such a gimmicky, flat concept to be executed.  While AC is something of a badass, this pub does not reflect the image of his avante-guard style.  In fact, its just pretty generic.\n\nI couldn't even recommend this as a meeting-for-a-beer-before-the-game spot, as the set-up is awkward when you do not have access to a table or stool (and you likely won't), so while standing up in the bar, you often feel like you are in someone's way -- either the patrons fighting for elbow room to gnaw their sliders or the pitifully eye-made wait staff expediting that woeful fare.\n\nStill, to its credit, Cooper'stown has been a downtown pioneer, and everyone should give the beautiful warehouse building a hearty brick-slap in appreciation of its solidarity as a Phoenician-style Mos Eisley."
One,"""Service is beyond sub par.  Brunette waitress who appears to be pregnant acts like taking your order is inconvenient.  My food sat in the window while the cook rang the bell over and over and she walked up and yelled \how many times are you going to ring the bell\"""". \nNot surprisingly food was lukewarm but not poorly prepared.  Feel sorry for the kitchen since cold food and long waits clearly aren't their issue.  Several people in the bar were overserved to the point of a drunken stupor (illegal in Scottsdale).  Fight almost broke out between two men next to me.  \n\nNeeds real management.  Likely a candidate for the show Bar Rescue."""""""

Great sound, lighting, good space, comfortable seats...Big enough to have a lot of energy but not so big that you feel like you are in a sea of people. \n\nIt's not the place for you if you want a crazy, mosh pit atmosphere, but I'm an old man now, and I've outgrown my mosh pit days. \n\nThe space has high ceilings, and touches like acoustic tiles, that make it a really versatile venue. You could see a rock show, or a symphony, and the main hall is well equipped to handle it all. \n\nThe show was incredible, fun. is amazing live, so that helped too, but I would happily return to this venue for a concert, classical, rock or anything in between."
One,"Zoe's is probably not a place to go if you are a Vegan. Actually, it's probably not a place to go if you are a T-rex either. When it comes down to it, this chain is no better than Chik-fil-a in what it offers. At least with Chik-Fil-A I get my food quickly and a nice side of cross-cut fries.\n\nZoe's Kitchen sits across the street from My Florist which, when you really think about it, was a dumb move on corporate's part. Both look to provide healthy food options in a market of fast food and grease. The problem is that, despite My Florist's problems, it is local, more diverse, and doesn't make you feel like you are eating in an Ikea showroom.\n\nThe food is just bad. My chicken sandwich was dry. Drier than the Mohave dry. I'm trying not to dive into other forms of hyperbole but this chicken was born and raised inside a Popiel Food Dehydrator. The least they could do would be to provide me with some mayo to fix things up a bit.\n\nThere's another one of these over on Camelback, it may or may not be better, but as far as our downtown one goes, this place will never see me or my money again."
Four,"I'm a little hesitant to start running / biking on the canals again, since my Golden Retriever fell in and nearly drowned the last time I did, thankfully there was a helpful Marine on the other side...\n\nHowever, I biked from Camelback and Scottsdale Road to Central yesterday, and man did I have a great time. Cool breezes and water right below you is nice. I'm pretty sure I saw something move in the water too... Yes, it's pretty boring and not so scenic, like Sarah and Gabi noted, but it's out of the way of traffic. I feel way more safe riding along the canal than riding along Indian School Road...\n\nPeople seem to be pretty good about cleaning up after their dogs. The Arizona Falls tidbit is pretty cool for a desert city. Overall, it's just a great place to run / bike / walk. I should definitely use the canal more than I do."
Five,"I went here for dinner with some friends. It met my expectations and more. The food was delicious and well presented. For starters I had Tom ka gai (Coconut Chicken soup) which is now my favourite! I also tried some of the starters platter, which was tasty as well. I especially liked the satay chicken.\n\nThe menu was the perfect size, enough variety for most restrictions and palates, we have a varied group (from on a diet, vegetarian, peanut allergy, to eats anything). At the same time it wasn't huge and unmanageable. I had the crispy basil chicken which was flavourful as well and I tried my friends dishes which were excellent, especially the curries.\n\nThe service was as good as the food and atmosphere. We never felt rushed or ignored; neither did the waitress interrupt us. Five stars for her! Some of our party members were late but we were still seated on time without any hassle despite it being a busy Friday night.\n\nI'm definitely coming back again. This place is trendy. I think this place would be suitable for a date, celebration or when you just want good thai food."
Three,"Restaurant week review...so we have not eaten here for dinner previously so we cannot comment on the RW menu and food vs the normal menu, however nothing we had would lure us back.\n\nAtmosphere is nice and pleasant, however the open floor plan makes it a bit noisy. Food seemed reasonably priced and portions were sufficient. Service was excellent. \n\nFood: For starters we had the soup, which had a good consistency but lacking. It was too sweet and not enough earthy flavors. The shrimp was decent but nothing special.\n\nFor entrees we had the shepherd's pie, which was was not thick enough,  bland, and not even as good as the one you can get at Costco. The crispy whitefish over dirty rice was tasty but lacking a nice sauce to help the overall dry consistency of the dish. Someone else at the table had the pulled pork and said it was good but not great.\n\nThe best part of our meals were the desserts, chocolate covered bacon s'mores and coconut cake. Both would be worthy closers to a nice meal."
Four,"One of my favorite Arizona style Mexican joints. Their chips are always hot and fresh made. Their salsa is nice and spicy. The red is a little smoky. The green is hot and flavorful. Their guac, if you order it, is fresh made and tasty.They have a few stand out items on the menu.\n\nAlbondingas Soup - mexican meatball soup. It's about $5, huge, comes with a plate of refried beans and warm tortillas, your choice of corn or flour. (Corn, bishes!#@) Delicious, filling, and relatively healthy. \n\nTamales. I love their green corn tamales. They have green sauce on them and some hot chile inside. Yum!\n\nShort ribs. Yup. Grilled and very meaty. Delicious.\n\nEnchiladas. Perfect.\n\nIf you like menudo, you can order it with or without the hoof. I don't like medudo or hooves, so you're on your own, but it seems popular with patrons who have that inverse make a run for the border vibe.\n\nThe reviewers who panned this place must have smoked crack before visiting. Or filed the wrong report at the wrong place. They can't be talking about Rositas!"
Five,"I heard a lot of mixed reviews from friends and from yelp but went to check it out last week and had an great time! \nWe showed up at 7 on a Saturday, so we expected a wait, but we found a seat at the huge indoor/outdoor bar and had a few drinks while we waited.\nWe loved the atmosphere and long tables & bench seating, other people were eating outside too. A band started playing at 9; the servers were very relaxed and casual but had great menu knowledge!! (which I always a good sign)\nSIDEBAR: they have a waiter who looks like a cross between Ricky Martin and The Situation.\nof COURSE we tried the pretzel fondue. Awesome. As well as the olives appetizer. I had the ahi tuna salad which was large and filling and my boyfriend had the ribs which he oogled they were better than Banderas haha.\nAll in all, great time, will return!!"
Three,"Typical of Phx but it sucked parking and getting there and trying to leave once in Tempe.  I highly recommend getting somebody to drop you off and try to meet up with them afterwards at a predefined location.\n\nIt's cool though because they have beer (carbs) afterwards and all the liquid stops well staffed with lots of cups everywhere.  HINT:  shoot for the end of the row, nobody goes there and way less crowded.\n\nThe music along the way is pretty cool but honestly once you zone in... I never heard em anyways.  The sign holders run a pretty tight pace according to their time on the sign so you can always pace them as well.\n\nSome of the pavement to concrete transitions suck along the way and concrete hurts that far into the run but not much they can do about that."
Four,"As far as breweries go, Four Peaks pretty much delivers.  Four Peaks has a good selection of beers on tap - plus a decent seasonal selection.  You're most likely not going for the food.  It's pretty basic bar stuff - chips and dip, chicken fingers, etc.  \n\nI went to the location in Scottsdale for a friend's birthday recently.  The restaurant was nice enough to give us the entire upstairs section with the pool table.  Or maybe they were trying to keep us contained!  They did seem happy when we left.  Oops!"
Four,"I enjoy coming here every so often for some fresh produce and baked goods.  I live about one mile away so it is convenient.  The produce is always fresh and affordable.  It is a great place to find some of the more exotic items like fresh lemon grass and other greens.   \n\nI usually spend about $10 to $15 for a couple of bags of vegetables and then go home and do my gastronomic magic.\n\nParking can be a struggle.  It seems that there is always someone in front of you creating a parking nightmare for no reason.\n\nThe fresh eggs taste great.  The fresh fish is good, but terribly overpriced.  I am especially fond of the specialized honey and by-products offered.\n\nA good way to spend a Saturday morning."
Three,"To start with the good, the sandwich was delicious. I ordered the turkey bacon ranch and it was on par with what you can expect from a cafe deli. The turkey was savory, the bacon was crispy, the produce was chilled, and the bread was fresh. If we're going on food alone, it was a home run.\n\nThe ordering experience was another story. The young girl who initially helped me was great. She was new and seemed to not know of the processes, but she was certainly trying and I can't fault that on her. Unfortunately, her manager was not nearly as supportive. It took the young girl almost 5 minutes to drag this woman (the manager) out of her office to fix a problem on the register, and when she finally made it to the front of the counter, she didn't even say hi or acknowledge I was even standing there. There wasn't even what would closely resemble a smile on her face.\n\nIf that young lady who served me happens to be reading this, you were great and this review doesn't reflect you. I only hope that in the future your management team gives you the support you deserve."
Two,"""It's a nice roomy place with a smelly carpet but the chairs are uncomfortable for sleeping if you get stuck there.

Four,"My favorite thing about eating at French places is cheese plates and wine so naturally this is what I ordered at Petite Maison. And it definitely did not disappoint. Four types of cheese ranging from blue to soft and creamy came with an assortment of sides such as mini-pickles (gherkins?), sauces and breads. Delicious! I also had a satisfying salad and a French press coffee. While normally I love French press this one left something to be desired, but it did the job and fueled me through the night with its caffeine content.\n\nThe space is smallish and quaint with a nice bar as well as a cute patio area. Their beer list is surprisingly well done, as is the wine list, of course. Take a date here or have a business lunch with a potential client to impress. Perhaps you'll seal the deal in either case."
Five,"The food here was heavenly.  We got the Siamese Kisses to start off with.  They were very light and absolutely delicious.  It's served with a soy based sweet dipping sauce, sambal, and what I could only describe as a curried mustard which was fantastic.  \n\nI got a pot of the Tom Ka Gai soup.  I have dreams about it every night now.  It's so freaking delicious!!  I ate about half the pot so I was lucky enough to have the rest for lunch the next day.  My husband got the small order of Pad Thai which ended up being really big!  He asked them to make it as spicy as possible.  It was really delicious but he didn't think it was very spicy.  It's nothing against them though, he's a total freak of nature when it comes to spicy food and I've never seen him think something was hot enough.  He still thoroughly enjoyed and said he would definitely order it again.  \n\nWe ended our meal with the pumpkin custard.  It was insanely good.  They cook inside a sugar pumpkin and just cut pieces out of the pumpkin to serve it.  It tasted like the best pumpkin pie you'd ever had with a hint of coconut.  I only wish we had ordered two instead of sharing one.\n\nOur server was fantastic too.  We sat outside, we were the only people sitting outside and I didn't feel like we were being ignored at all.  He was very attentive and nice!  We had all that food, my husband had a drink with alcohol, and I had a soda, the bill was $44 before tip which isn't bad at all.  We will definitely be back!"
Two,"""We ordered 5 entrees.\n\n\n6 meat Ragu sauce was undeniably good but the homemade pasta was just  \meh\"""". It was too doughy and not al dente enough.\n\nCarbonara - It was okay.

It was huge and it was just \""""okay\"""". \n\nIt's a small 8 table restaurant.  The owner did come by our table to greet us but he was not as friendly to us as to other patrons.

Four,"""I love you Trader Joe's.  No, you are not \my\"""" grocery store.  I can't commit to you as my one and only baby.  It's not you, it's me.  I am tempted by the fruit of another.

You know no matter how many times I stray, I'll always come back to you.  You don't need to worry about the items I buy at Safeway baby, that's different. That's just shopping.  What we have is something more than that.\n\nI love it whenever I discover something new about you.  I can't live without your hummus or your mediterranean style yogurt.  It reminds me of crisp mornings in the Amphora Hotel in Chania harbor.  Of course the honey here will never be as magical as it was in Greece but that's not your fault dear.\n\nI love that you know I'm not made of money.  I don't have to flash a lot of brass to impress you and that always makes me feel accepted and appreciated.  Even when you're cold, or feeling like you can't give me the things I want (because let's face it you're *always* out of stock on something I really like) I can always find something to make me feel like our time together is special and well worth the effort.\n\nIt might be another week or so until our next visit baby, but you know you're gonna be on my mind and when I hunger for something only you can provide, you know I'll be back.

Three,"""The dilemma:  Feed 10 of Sally Struthers' children for a month or go to the movies and snack bar.  Movies won this time.\n\nMy first experience with this theater led me back to AMC.  Overcrowded and overrun with children of all ages.  That's all it takes for me.\n\nHowever, we decided to take in a movie yesterday evening (Sunday) after the mall had closed.  Far less crowded and an all-around more pleasant experience, thankfully, as my cheap ass does not like to pay $9.50 for a movie to begin with.  I was mildly irritated that when I ordered a small (child size) popcorn, the concession idiot tried to up sell me to a large with a free refill.  Now either I ordered a small because I don't think $6.25 for  popcorn is reasonable or I ordered a small because I don't want a 55-gallon drum of it to begin with.  Anyhow, it was over salted and I made the mistake of asking for \butter.\""""  That would be some oily substance that the popcorn was bathed in.\n\nI'll come here again when the mall is closed or when gas reaches $17.85 a gallon, but much prefer AMC Esplanade just down the road."""""""
One,"I am trying to like Black Angus because I love steak and their sweet potato fries are delicious - when dining in... but every single to go order I've placed in the past year and a half has been a failure. I would give them 0 stars if I could.\n\n1. Their steak is either overcooked (one time it was burnt!!!) or way undercooked. Last week I ordered a medium and a medium rare and they both came rare!!! \n2. Their fillet mignion is nothing but cartilage and fat... I guess that's what I get for ordering their $15 fillet mignion special... I can't believe they even have the gutts to call it steak!!! \n3. If you order sweet potato fries as part of your to go order, more often than not you will get their left overs - burnt, bits and pieces of sweet potatoes. Unacceptable!\n4. Their lobster is like rubber.\n5. Several times they did not add bread to my order because they ran out... how about trying to make it up to me? Isn't complimentary bread included in the overall cost of the food?!\n6. Stay away from their side caesar salad! It's whilted. \n\nI would never place a to go order with Black Angus - they take advantage of the fact that you can't check what they pack up for you and then charge you up for premium steak dinner! Save your money and go to The Keg or Firebird's. They are a little pricier but the food is top notch. Given that my to go experience with Black Angus has been so disappointing, I will definitely not dine in there again either. Their dining experience has not been much better in terms of food quality, and the last time we went there we were left standing for 10 minutes before anyone even ackowledged us."
One,"""You shouldn't leave a restaurant feeling upset and humiliated.  But we did!\n\nEarlier tonight, my son jokingly said that he wanted British food for dinner.  Having heard the stories of our adventures in England and just how bad the food was there, this is a bit of a running joke in our house.  But then I thought of all of the amazing reviews about this place on Yelp, and how we thought it might become a regular haunt for us.\n\nSo we hopped in the car with our two kids and headed out.\n\nAfter parking, we walked up to the restaurant, where 3 people were sitting below the entry door and patio.  We went up to the door and looked around, not quite sure where to go.  There was no staff, and no obvious stand with a hostess, but I saw two empty big booths outside on the patio.  So I left my husband and two kids standing around by the door outside while I went inside.  I was greeted by the side of a bar.  Still no staff or obvious hostessing area.  I walked across the restaurant and saw a couple of empty tables, another empty table outside, and a lot of space up at the bar.  The only staff were standing at the kitchen bar area, and one girl was loading up with plates.  Still no obvious hostess.  I told the girl that we were new and had never been there before, and asked if we just seat ourselves.  She said \Yeah\"""".  I said \""""Great, we'll sit outside then.  Will somebody know to come serve us?\""""  Again--affirmative.\n\nSo I went back outside and told my husband we could sit down.  At this point, one of the two booths had been taken and so we seated ourselves at the other.  My husband grabbed menus and we were browsing the menus.  The server came and greeted us, and half way through his greeting he just walked away over by where we entered.  I saw one of the people who'd been sitting by the door pointing over at us.\n\nThe server came back and told us that there was a waiting list (the three people by the door were now five).  He apologized, but we knew we were being ejected from our table.  The people at the table next to us were staring, and I was feeling guilty and humiliated that we had apparently stolen someone's table.\n\nFeeling extremely uncomfortable after both the lack of any greeting and having to track down staff AND their lack of communication, plus having other customers' eyes on us and obviously having angered the people waiting, we opted to leave.  I was feeling completely humiliated and ended up being upset for quite a while.\n\nSooo.. they may have great food, but I really have no desire to go back.  Hopefully they can work on greeting customers and their communication issues.  Obviously it wasn't meant to be a new regular joint for us."""""""
Two,"I grew up in the South, eating fried chicken with butter on butter with a side of buttered biscuits, and yet I truly dislike how buttery these cookies taste.\n\nConsidering I'm a total cookie fiend and can't even come up with a variety that I dislike, it should be relatively impossible to deter me from eating cookies. However, I've ended up at Urban Cookies a few times now and always find myself wondering, why am I wasting precious, precious stomach space on these when I could just trek on over to LGO's bakery and go nuts?\n\nI respect them conceptually and appreciate the idea of a gourmet cookie, but when it comes to the actual product, I'm not buying it (figuratively, because literally I already bought it, of course).\n\nGive me more flavor, more chocolate(!), more chewy substance and I'll be back. \nUntil then, I guess I'm just not Paula Deen enough for this place.

Four,"I joined it for the climbing wall, then found myself going there all the time. it is by far the best gym I have ever been to. Everything is spread out and there are enough machines and weights so I never really find myself waiting for anything. \n\nThey are also open 24 hrs so I can go at odd times. \n\nMy only complaint is that the climbing wall has very limited hours. I wish teh wall was open as long as the gym is!"
Five,"Great venue for live concerts!  I haven't eaten here, but I've seen a few shows.  The space is great--room to move, to sit, to people watch.  I know that people have mixed feelings about the bleachers at the back of the space, but I liked them.  They aren't intrusive, and they give you a place to sit down when you need it.  It wasn't particularly crowded for either show I saw, but the place isn't big, so that could be an issue.  A great addition to downtown."
Four,"My mom and I stopped in on a rainy Wednesday for lunch between Christmas and New Year.  \nThis place definitely busier than Sacred Hogan and I can say I enjoy this place almost as much.  I find that their fry bread here is thicker and crispier than that of Sacred Hogan and they salt their food well (to the point I didn't have to add any, and I think I have a salty palate). Sacred Hogan is not as generous with their salt (can be good and bad).  \nMy mom had the beef stew and I had the combo indian taco with red chile.  I can say that I would go back just for a bowl of their red chile beef,  and has me curious about their green chile, after having it on my taco (this coming from a Native New Mexico girl who knows her chile) .  It was not spicy but full of flavor.  My mom's beef stew was hearty and served with a good sized piece of fry bread and was quite tasty.  \nWe left stuffed and didn't eat another meal that day.  \n\nI will still find myself going to Sacred Hogan for their Lamb Sandwich, or their Mutton Stew but you may find me mixing in a little FBH now and again."
Two,"Meh.\n\nIt's been open long enough that the servers should know what they are doing.  Not quite.  Went on a week night and it wasn't really crowded.  Our server was funny but kept being pulled in 5 different directions.  Not to mention he overran my friends credit card by $86.  They fixed it promptly the next day but really?  \n\nI had the mac and cheese.  It was greasy!  Seriously, it was in a pool of oil.  The green chiles that are in the mac don't go well.  They also aren't chopped so it's like pulling out long stringy things amid a pool of oil.\n\nMy friend had the grilled cheese.  He said it was extrememly average.\n\nMeh."
Five,"An excellent burger joint with a lot of other offerings.\n\nI love a great burger.  Unfortunately most places overcook them and nobody else offers all the options that this place does.  The menu is unique in that you build your burger with dozens of options from the plate up.  I was going to say from the bun up, but you can even get it as a salad or lettuce wrap if you prefer no bun.\n\nThe options range from the typical cheddar and bacon, through interesting things like cranberries, various sweet and tangy sauces, and excellent alternative cheese options.  The garlic aioli combined with the horseradish mayo is awesome.\n\nSides go from the usual fries to some excellent house garlic-parmesan chips and sweet potato fries.  There is a full bar and a decent selection of non-generic beers available.\n\nThe owner is usually milling about talking to customers and helping the staff work."
Three,"This location of PW is right down the street from my house, so I eat here every once in a while.  It's predictable and uses good ingredients -- fresh veggies, all white meat chicken.  \n\nI like that they'll sub or add things for you.  I always add broccoli to any dish that doesn't have it or extra to a dish that does.  I'm a sucker for broccoli.  It's nice not to be charged too.  And the brown rice alternative is a good option.\n\nThe serving sizes are large and generally too much for one person.  We'll do take out from here ocassionally.  For 4 people, we'll order 3 entrees and one order of lettuce wraps and that's perfect...no left overs and no waste.  \n\nMy faves are the Spicey Korean with chicken and the Ginger Broccoli with Shrimp.\n\nIt's not cheap, but the ingredients are quality.  Not traditional Asian food, it's more fusion.  It is what it is and I like it."
Four,"Jason's Delis is a good lunch option. It has something for everyone. Salads, Sandwiches, Wraps, Soups, Pastas... \n\nThings I really like here are: Soups (French Onion & Chili are my favs), Sandwiches (NY Yankee, Amy O Turkey, Sgt Pepper), Salad Bar (lots of choices), and different flavored iced teas (unsweetened, sweetened, or fruity). I also like the different side options you can sub instead of chips. I usually get fresh fruit because I love their sweet yogurt dip that comes with it. \n\nPersonally I really like this place for the manager special - Half a sandwich and a cup of soup for about $7. I like that you can choose any sandwich you want (the options are endless or you can even make your own) and that they have about 7 different soups to choose from daily."
Five,"Ah.  Willow Stream... This is the best spa in Scottsdale, very clean, atmosphere is nice and relaxing, background music has a very calming effect.  The complimentary drinks, cookies and muffins is a nice touch along with the fresh apples.  Bottled water is available all throughout your visit too.  The service is excellent, from the moment you make a reservation to the moment you check in and during your treatment and in between all the way to when you check out.  I like checking in early in the morning and scheduling my treatment towards the late afternoon so I have the whole day to spend and just relax and forget about the outside world and lose myself in the comfort of Willow Stream...  I indulge myself in the rooftop pool and cabana, inhalation room, swiss shower, steam room, hot and cold tub, sauna, waterfall massage.   A nice healthy choice of light lunch and sitting in the courtyard is part of the relaxing process.   The facials and massages are awesome, I usually feel like I have been in another world upon leaving Willow Stream..."
Four,"""For someone who grew up going to Centerpointe (the name of this theater when it was owned by Harkins, before it closed), coming to MADCAP for the first time is a little weird. It's such a shell of its former self. \nThe escalators are blocked off, so you must stair it up to the second level. The concession and theaters on the first floor are not used, it appears. Perhaps for bigger fest events they're put to use?\nWe came to see Black Dynamite, but it took us several minutes to find the theater where it was playing. There was a random movie in one, a poetry slam in another, and no one - from the concession workers to the ticket worker - could tell us where it was. We eventually found it on our fourth try.\nA friend got some popcorn and I was floored when he said they didn't have butter for it. Wha? It's just ... dry popcorn? That's been prob sitting there for a few hours? What's the point? I know, it's better for you without the \butter flavoring,\"""" but an artery-clogging, movie-going staple!\nSo, all this sounds like I don't care for MADCAP, but that's not true. I love what they're doing, and I'll take a bare bones, butter-free operation to get my fill of cult classics, random indie greats, John Hughes fests, horror fests, b-flicks and more any day. And thank god someone is using that space - there's so much abandoned space and so many empty dirt lots in PHX it's just fucking embarrassing. So kudos, all around to MADCAP - what it stands for, what it offers, and even its skimpy concession."""""""
Three,"Only been here once, a Thursday night.  It was very busy (usually a good sign) and we waited 15 min for a table.  Had good chips/salsa, took a few minutes to get our drinks, then once we ordered food was out in maybe 15 minutes at the most.  I have chicken tacos, they were good.  I wasn't blown away by anything, but everything was solid.  I will definitely be going back, and would be willing to amend my review to 4 stars if they have a few spectacular items."

When I went to pay for it, there was 5 employees up front (with 1 register going) and a few customers waiting in line.  The employess were complaining that some of their shifts were over, and were also complaining that they don't get paid enough to work past their shifts.  So again I was inconveniencing them by try to purchase something from their store.  If I owned this place and heard or saw the staff acting like this, I would fire all of them and start over with staff who would appreciate the job"
Three,"Man this place was the SHIT when I was a youngster!! \n\nNow... this place IS shit! I don't know where it happened. I think it may have been the deteriorating of Phoenix's youth or what have you. I will be honest in saying that I haven't been to this place in quite sometime, but I still like to remember the good ol' days on the water log rides and on the small lil coaster my mom would allow me to ride. and the times when I snuck away from my mom to ride the big desert storm. and keeping her away from the pictures taken of passengers mid loop as they were displayed on lil tv screens near a makeshift giftshop. \n\nThe food never stuck out to me, so I really can't review it. But I know that for a while, when it was still new and well-ran. This was a nice place. It was small but compact so it felt like excitment was just around the corner. But now, it feels small and compact, like there's so many people around you just want to scream just so you can have some personal space. \n\nI don't really like the whole thing with different types of kids playing with the games hogging them and you gotta fight them for a turn. I've never been one for golf but I still ilke to get my Tiger Woods on once in a great while. \n\nI don't really think this is a nice date place anymore. It's too ghetto. I think this is a place you take your long-term someone special. Like when all the magic is gone and the honey moon is OVER so ya'll are alright to just show up and kick some lil high schooler's ass to to get the go-cart you've been eyeing the entire time you've been in line!\n\nBut still go!  Have fun, assert yourself and your spot in line and the dibs you called. And dude... TOTALLY play golf course #2, it's the best! :D"
Five,OMG!! This place is amazing! The boy and I came here for dinner on a whim one Monday night and the place was poppin! We grabbed a seat at a little table near the bar (the game was on). We started off with a bottle of riesling and a pepperoni pizza. The pizza was perfectly cooked and not too greasy and a crunchy crust. They have homemade lemon chello also amazing. I had the gnocchi for my entree. One of the best dishes I've ever had! It was perfect! Flavorful marinara and a sprig of basil. The boy had lasagna and I was a little concerned he was going to leave me for that dish! The entire experience was amazing. My new favorite restaurant!
Four,"I like this place...a lot.  It's not just mainstream Italian food either (meaning- it's no Olive Garden).  In fact, it's better, and your food never tastes like it had been frozen and heated up in a microwave 10 minutes ago.  \n\nThe atmosphere is casual, and it's family friendly, so you don't have to worry that you shouldn't bring your little ones. The prices are reasonable too- considering the amount of food you get.  You will most likely have leftovers, and be able to make at least one other meal out of your entree.  \n\nI really like the veggie lasagna and the pizza.  The salads are all good too, and their chocolate dessert with the ice cream (not sure what it's called) is amazing!"
One,"I've been in sales and customer service/client management for over thirty years and I can't think of the last time I've seen a more uncaring attitude than what I saw today.  One of our boarding passes misprinted and we had to reprint at the airport.  As I was reprinting it we had two couples walk past talking about the worst customer service ever, never flying US Airways again, rudest they've ever been treated, etc. \n\nWe were at the gate over an hour early and I decided to check the score on the Niners' game at the bar.  While I was walking there I passed the US Airways Customer Service counter.  I went to the CSR and explained the situation and suggested that if someone talked to them to find out what the situation and suggest that they could probably rectify the situation. \n\nThe response stunned me.  Her answer was that it's not worth doing because she's been in the industry nearly 30 years and some people are just never happy.  If she offered a free meal they'd be mad that it wasn't two.  If she offered a $5 food voucher they'd be mad that it wasn't $10 and that if they were that mad they'd come to her to talk about it. \n\nShe finalized that it just isn't worth trying to make these passengers happy and that she's heard that people will never fly her airline again because next week if US Airways is the lowest price those people will be right back on US Airways. \n\nNice job, Lady at the Customer Service counter who's name I'm really tempted to use here.  If you'd shown that you cared about the customer enough to even find out what the situation was you might have retained four customers.  As it is you just lost six."
Two,"Well, folks in the Valley don't have to settle for the factory made stuff any more! As many transplants from the East Coast already know, Rita's Italian Ice is a fresh-made product made in the store daily! There are two Rita's in the Phoenix area right now: one in Glendale and one in the Arcadia neighborhood in Phoenix (48th St. & Indian School). The on Indian School (where I've been) is VERY clean! They have high school kids servicing in the afternoons, but there is always one of the owners on site too! It's a great, friendly and yummy place for some great Italian Ice! Worth the drive if you haven't been there yet!"
Five,"I love my eye doctor!  Platonically, of course.  The entire staff is relaxed, friendly, easy going, and personable.  No one ever makes you feel rushed but instead take time to make sure that everything is okay, that you've thought of everything, gotten all of your questions answered, and had plenty of time to make decisions and think.  The doctor takes time to get to know you and to talk about how you use your eyes (staring at the computer, sports, etc).  The assistants try to think of things from your point of view so they can volunteer useful information and ask a lot of specific questions while doing so.  This place treats you like family.  There's a broad range of styles, but mostly, they're fashionable frames.  When I go in, I see a lot of kids, young adults, and 20 and 30-somethings as well as the older patients who so often come to need glasses.  Horwitz costs a little more than the mall chains, but my prescriptions have been consistently better thanks to the doctor taking time, the lenses are much higher quality, and the frames are worlds better in terms of availability of things that aren't ugly and durability."
Five,I love this place. I used to not be a big fan of polish food but then my Dad dragged me here and I've been hooked ever since. The Hunter's Stew and the Kielbasa platter are to die for and the service is excellent. I have never been disappointed with this place and plan on making a trip there this weekend. They also do these cooking classes which are a bit expensive but I sort of want to try one.
Five,"I love this bar. Over 100 beers and free art and music nightly, umm . Me likes. They also do this art drawing night once a month. Peeps are chill, bartenders are hot and sweet. Nice patio for smoking. No food but they are adding it soon. Great coffee next door. 5th street is a trip, but it is the center of 1st friday, so go on another night, unless you're up for the crowds. This is where I'll call home for awhile."
Five,"This place is AMAZING!!! Fresh, yes that is Fresh meat, not that frozen/small meat that you get at YC's. The meat doesn't shrink like it does at YC's. You don't have to guess on the sauces and or mess around with making them. Service has always been great and friendly, I think I have eaten there about 25 times in the last year and I have always been extremely happy. The drink specials are second to none. It really bothers me when people are complaining about the price, it is like 10 bucks, if you cant afford 10 bucks for a meal that you are going out for then maybe you should stay in. Also people that are mad about sizes, you do know you can go back up, they are all you can eat for like a couple more bucks, but if you make it right you should never have to go back up. This place is so so good, they are busy all the time, and it is a really fun place to check out. Everyone should go there!!!"
Five,"My husband works close to the area, and we are scouting out a move to the area so I've really been happy to see what they are doing here. It's reminiscent of outdoor shopping centers like Desert Ridge. It seems like about 1/2 the shops seems to be open and that new things are opening each week. The nice thing is that the stores here don't seem expansive and huge just because they have the space. As such, it's decently close to us (although there are other places to shop that are closer) but it has a nice mix of shops and such that I think I'll be making the drive a bit more often."
Three,"Update: The Bf and I went here for dinner tonight to use our Living Social deal. Yet again, I felt that the prices were inflated and the flavor was nothing special. We got the steak tacos, the queso fundido, arroz con crema, and platanos. They serve the food 'tapas' style (so small portions). Our deal also came with 2 margaritas. The margaritas were very good. I liked how fresh it tasted. The steak taco had decent flavor, but the steak was very chewy (like you bite into the taco and couldn't cut the steak with your teeth)....that was not pleasant. The queso fundido was mediocre. It did not have a ton of flavor and the duck was also kind of chewy. It does come with a bit more food though, so that's a plus I guess. The rice was probably the best part of the meal (which it should be because it is expensive for a small portion). It was creamy, yet fresh as it had corn in it and fresh herbs on top. The plantains were alright, although all of the cheese and whatnot on top was somewhat unnecessary in my opinion. I probably would not go back to this restaurant unless someone else was buying :-P"
One,"""If it were not for the chips and salsa, I would never return to this restaurant. I have been going there since I was a kid. In the past year or so, the service has gotten so bad, I wouldn't even believe it is the same restaurant. I only get carry out now, and that is only when I am craving the chips and salsa. \n\nEven their carry out food service is terrible, unfortunately. My past 4 visits, I have called over 30-45 minutes in advance to my order, and upon arrival nobody has prepared it. During one visit (The Friday before 2012 Superbowl), it took me 45 minutes AFTER I arrived for them to get me 2 bags of chips and 2 portions of salsa. Another woman had been waiting there longer than me. We were both waiting on chips and salsa ONLY. That should never happen.\n\nMy last visit was 3/3/12 and again, I called 35 minutes before arriving to order chips and salsa for a party. I walked in and waited 7 minutes before being greeted. The hostess then went to \find out\"""" who took my order and returned and told me I had to go to the cantina/bar to pay and get them. Once I got in there, I stood for 15 minutes trying to get the attention of someone walking by so I could get my order. Finally a man brought it to me. I was so fed up. I do not think I can return. I am sick of being treated like they don't need or even WANT my business.\n\nI have never received an apology from any of them for taking so long, and not having my order ready, even when I gave them plenty of notice AND the orders were simple."""""""
Three,"I am a huge fan of Postino's, it is one of the best places in town for bruschetta and wine! When I found out the owners of Postino's were opening up a new spot I was super excited to try it out. My friend and I decided to check it out this past Monday for lunch and we were not very impressed. We ordered there fondue as an appetizer and it was very dissapointing, the cheese was grainy and cold. They serve it with a heep of barbecue meat, apples, salami, and pretzel bread. I will not order this again! The food was ok, I ordered the ban-mi and my friend had the pulled pork sandwich. We both agreed that both sandwiches were lacking in flavor. The best thing I did have was the side that came with my sandwich which was the fried okra it was delicous. Overall we were dissapointed with this place and will continue to stick with our favorite Postino's."
Four,"Every time I've been here, the salad bar is clean and the tables even cleaner. The amount of meal options you have makes the price okay, so I load up on plenty of yummy salad, pizza focaccia, and frozen yogurt with a mountain of sprinkles. \n\nI really appreciate that they change up their food focus monthly so it's not the same exact thing every time. This month it's grilled cheese focaccia bread and tomato soup and it is HEAVENLY. I always wonder what they would do if I took the day off of work and spent my time off, open to close, attempting to eat through their food. The employees are really nice, especially the bussers who sometimes ask if I would like a refill on my coke... As my family says, you never know until you try! \n\nI still haven't ruled out the idea."
Five,"""Growing up in Phoenix, I have always eyed Long Wong's while in the family car.  \n\n\Is it Chinese food?\""""\n\nNo.\n\nMy friend had taken me there yesterday for lunch.  She had claimed these are the best wings ever and I was a bit skeptical.  I mean, what can be better than Buffalo Wild Wings?\n\nI had ordered the Honey-Hot and my friend got Medium.  Upon first bite, it was pure bliss!  The wings were deep-fried perfectly and the sauce had me burning up with a sweet after-taste.\n\nThis is by far the best place for wings!  If only they'd kick out annoying high school brats...  XD!"""""""
Five,I put my body through hell and back.. some months Ill low carb others Ill eat WAY to much of everything.. the American yoyo diet I suppose. On the eve of my low carb madness I come to Europa to pick up a few goodies.\n\nThe cheese and cherry coffee cake is the BEST Ive ever tasted! Moist flaky crust covered in cheese and canned cherries.. sheer delight and a real middle finger to the low carb diet! \n\nI feel so good and bad all at the same time.
Five,"""Had the pleasure of getting together with Scott W. for lunch here today.  It was my first visit to this Macayo's & I ordered a \Mex 'n' Match\"""" Lunch Special, with a bowl of Tortilla Soup, a (Pablano) Chile Relleno, shredded beef taco, steamed mixed vegetables, & of course their great chips & salsa.\n\nThe atmosphere here was just right, as was the service from Rene, every bite of the food, & the price, so it's a big 5 Stars for Macayo's Glendale!\n\nMex 'n' Match Weekday Lunch Special with two main items & two sides:  $9.99\n\n\u00a1Yumamundo!     :-))"""""""
Two,"""I have to agree with the a previous reviewer when he says that he had 'a real mixed experience'...I am giving it 2 stars, but part of me wants to say 1... \n\nWe ordered this as room service, they were having a really good deal on room rates, which included $25 dining credit and waived resort fee...(but enough about that, I'll talk about it in the hotel review later...)... \n\nAnywho, we ordered from the breakfast menu (YAY! Look at us, awake before 11am on a Sunday! hahahaha in your face, Sucka!) \n\nUm...yeah, so the boy ordered the chicken fried chicken breakfast w/ a bagel on the side and I ordered the McCormick Omelet w/ a side of toast (yes...you have to pay extra to get toast with your omelet, bizarre) and 2 small cups of juice...um...$44??? YIKES! Okay, so yes, it's room service, but do you really need to GOUGE people like that? \n\nNevertheless, we paid the piper...(only to find out that the $25 dining credit isn't valid for breakfast the next day...only for the night you check in...would've been nice for someone to SHARE that info...but again, that's reaching back into the hotel review... \n\nHere's the bad...when the $9 chicken fried chicken \breakfast\"""" was revealed, it turned out to be two chicken strips on a couple of biscuits with sausage gravy drizzled on it...and no...I don't mean some sort of fancified McDonald's extra crispy chicken breast select strips, I mean, the kind that you get when you order off of the kids meal at a restaurant. 1/2 a step above a chicken nugget. *sigh* He was heartbroken. I could see it in his eyes. I was also heartbroken, because I had planned to scam a biteful from his plate. *sniffle* \n\nHere's the good...the omelette was very tasty. But the BEST part of it was the Sonoran Breakfast Potatoes. Absolutely delicious, I believe they are hashbrowns with sour cream, jalapenos, and some other seasoning in them, but it definitely is the reason that the review is at 2 stars instead of 1. \n\n(Also, once we got past the whole chicken strip mental barrier, it wasn't bad...but seriously, that was not a $44 breakfast, we didn't even get any alcohol in the juice!)"""""""
Two,"Walking in to Five Guys, I was rather excited, and was looking forward to my experience. I have never been to a Five Guys before, so this was something new. My first reaction upon opening the doors was the music was blaring. Too loud, at least. The music was classic rock, which I don't mind. After walking up and reviewing the easily understood menu and waiting in line for a few minutes, someone took our order. The order taker seemed like she was having a long day, not seeming very interested in the customer. While taking the order, one could clearly see the kitchen. It seemed kind of like In-N-Out, but everyone was moving much slower. It was as if everyone was moving in slow motion.\n\nMuch to my dismay, they did not offer Dr. Pepper, my favorite soft drink. I was surprised that they offered other lesser known drinks, but not Dr. Pepper? Come on. After waiting about 6 or 7 minutes, my food arrived in a bag. A bag? Really? I was planning on eating inside, not take out. Even McDonald's does better than that. Digging through the bag I first took out the fries, which were in a cup, and I took a bite. My first impression of the fries was they were nothing special, and too salty. I like salt on my fries as it adds flavor, but there was simply too much salt. As a result, in addition to the fact that the serving was quite large, I finished only about half of my fries.\n\nNow onto the burger. I paid about $10 for my meal, so I was thinking to myself that this better be the best burger I have ever tasted in a long time. Unwrapping the product in its tin foil wrapping, I noticed that the presentation of the burger was sub par. The burger did not look appetizing, at all. Almost disgusting, as a matter of fact. The cheese was dripping over the bun, and I couldn't even see all the ingredients on the burger. Taking my first bite, it didn't taste bad. A pretty classic American burger taste, I must say. It did taste rather close to Wendy's. \n\nUpon finishing my meal, I was not impressed. My stomach felt greasy, and I felt the need to go hike a mountain a couple times, which I did, as Tempe Butte is close by. I felt my stomach almost on the point of rejecting it, it was that greasy. Seriously. Overall, Five Guys is way to expensive, unbelievably greasy, and makes your stomach cringe. The atmosphere is nice though, thus the two stars. \n\nIf you had to choose between Five Guys and In-N-Out, INO is the clear winner in every category."
Four,A tasty pho place that you can enter from the street or from inside the asian market that it's connected to.\n\nI ordered the veggie soup with rice noodles. The soup arrived relatively fast and it came with a metric ton of fresh veggies as well as tofu. It was delicious!\n\nThe service was great - the servers were very attentive and friendly. I think 3 different people asked my husband if he needed a refill on his water. \n\nI really liked this place and I'll definitely be back.
Four,"The salad was mind-boggling.  Seriously, it was like a party in my mouth with so many unique flavors.  It wasn't very big, but I'll pay whatever it takes to taste that again.\n\nThe calamari was great by calamari standards, but it was small for the $10 price tag.  \n\nThe filet mignon was perfect.  That's all I need to say about that.\n\nThe mushroom dish was good, but I was expecting a lot more after reading all these reviews.  It definitely needs some meat, the polenta didn't cut it.\n\nThe bread pudding was very good, but I wasn't a fan of the licorice-flavored ice cream it came with.  \n\nOverall, my food experience here was excellent and I'll be coming back."
Five,"I am a big BBQ fan. I really love that down south BBQ and prior to finding Fritzi's earlier this year I was going to Honey Bears any chance I'd get. Now that I've found Fritzi's, honey bears doesn't even belong in the same sentence. I travel a lot and I always try to find that good bbq place while on the road and I've found some good ones. But I am confident in saying that Fritzi's is by far one of the best I've found and its right here in my home state ! Anyway, Fritzi's is located in the same complex as Del Taco and Home Depot off Dysart and i-10. The food here is absolutely spectacular. If you like Ribs, Chicken Wings, or even Pull Pork sandwhiches, whatever you like its ALL excellent. They slow cook the ribs of course, the meat just falls off the bones and it is some of the meatiest ribs I have ever eaten in my life. But like all good bbq places its the sauce that makes all the difference, and Fritzi makes some of the best sauce you have ever tasted ! This is a mom and pop owned goldmine, dont miss out ! I try to go atleast once a week, in fact there is a picture of me on the wall for being such a good customer ! \n\nIf you go there for lunch 4 bone ribs is all you need, I believe it comes with 1 side, but it might be 2. For sides I usually get Mac and Cheese & Sweet Potato Casserole both are amazing ! A friend of mine really loves the Mixed Greens ! \n\nIf you going for Dinner 6 bones will do, I usually get a full rack (12 bones) and eat it over a few days ! They taste great re-heated as well ! \n\nI guess thats about it, its St. Louis Style BBQ. Amazing stuff try for yourself. P.S. They have really good, deserts, beef brisket and cat fish as well !"
Five,"Last week my Garage door made a huge sound and I found out that the Torsion Spring on my Garage door busted. I Googled for a Garage door Company and Precision Door Service had a very high customer reviews. I called them, Darian came out.. He was done in 45 minutes. Explained the job and made my door work like never before . I researched further they work on Commercial and Residential garage doors and openers. I also found they are a Nation wide company and have good reviews all over the USA !!!"
One,"I went  here while visiting from the Bay area with my boyfirend and his borther....we wanted some bomb bbq and figured Arizona should have some good places,,,,or at least decent... We came to big Earl's super hungry ready to chomp on some good 'ol bbq.. We came,sat down looked at the menu,ordered then looked up the reviews on Yelp....damn we should have done that first... We all ordered the ribless combo for $21.99.............................................. Man were we all bummed when we tasted our food....it was pale and soooooo dry and had a lot of fat. We tried dousing the meat with the bbq sauce to make it less dry but the bbq sauce is so terrible that it makes it worse...  We each had briskit,hot links, pulled chicken, and pulled pork...we spent $84.00 and, in the end  took it as acomplete loss...we left about 85% of our food. We've eaten bbq from all over the country and have come across a few not so good ones but when corn bread is the only thing that saves you from stravation at a bbq spot when theres a huge plate of meat in front of you...theres an issue.. Dont go there........... Seriously... Its bad... Quite disappointing,...."
Four,"""Why I have been waiting to write a review about this place is beyond me but I'm here now :)\n\nThe guy who works the front counter was super nice.  Fantastic bacon!!

Five,"I will admit I didn't have the highest of expectations for Canteen as Mill Ave has disappointed before. What I did have was a Groupon so on Friday night the boyfriend and I decided to cash it in. \n\nWalking in I was surprised at how nice the place was. And the hostesses were friendly too. My expectations began to change. There was a wait since it was Friday but once we were seated we got a great booth and settled in. The atmosphere is great for date night. \n\nI ordered a hibiscus margarita and the pork chop and boyfriend ordered chicken tacos and onion rings. The margarita was delish - which if you're gonna call yourself a tequila bar, it better be good. They delivered. The pork chop was amazing. It was seasoned perfectly and nice and juicy. It was served on a cheesy, slightly spicy rice that complimented it perfectly.\nBoyfriend really liked his tacos and the dip that comes with the onion rings is awesome. We were stuffed but had to try the rice pudding anyway. It was also tasty - creamy and cinnamon-y served with mini sopapillas. A nice wrap up to the meal.\n\nAnd throughout the night the staff was great. My water glass was always full, our waiter checked back with us several times and the service was quick with everything. Other restaurants could use a lesson from the Canteen staff on how to treat customers. We felt comfortable and taken care of all night.\n\nMy expectation were far surpassed. I can't wait to go back to Canteen. Even without a Groupon the food and drinks are worth it. Great place!"
Three,"Their burritos are HUGE!! Almost the size of my forearm! But bigger is not always better. It's slightly above all the -bertos places but I've definitely had better. The carne asada just didn't do it for me. I like my asada with nice grilled marks and I didn't find that here. Also, their salsas were boring; it was watered down and no substance. \n\nI've tried some of the Chorizo here before and that was pretty good. And I've heard the menudo was excellent, but I'm not a fan of menudo so that doesn't suffice.\n\nFrom what I've read it looks like the Carne Asada fries are the business, which I might give a try the next time I roll through the drive-thru."
Five,"This is the place. If you are from Utah like me, that phrase has some significance to you. \n\nAnywho, I walked into Kazimierz for a friend's birthday celebration (once I found it), and I was treated to a place that had the ambiance of a bar/lounge that you see in movies.\n\nLights low, plush couches. Wines. Olives. Cheeses. Canoodling. Fun live music.\n\nThis is a classy establishment. Leave your JV friends at home or at some of the other establishments around Scottsdale like Pattie's, Mulligans, etc. And for Godssake, wear something nice!\n\nI know very little about wine. I'm more of a craft beer guy, but the staff had no problem explaining different wines to me. No attitude. I like that.\n\nBring a date here. Bring a good friend. Most importantly, bring someone you care about. It's worthy."
Three,"""I've stopped into the Rose & Crown on a few occasions for a couple drinks.\n\nLet me say that it is just not my kind of place.\n\nMy kind of place doesn't have gaps in the floor boards so big that my 5\ heels get stuck and I almost bail (on more than one occasion, I might add).  Oh wait, I DID bail once, which was embarrassing since I am sure people thought I was drunk.\n\nIt does have good, strong, drinks though.  That's a plus for a bar!\n\nI've enjoyed myself out on the patio with friends, new and old.  \n\nIf I do stop into Rose & Crown again, I will be sending in the hubs to get the drinks so I don't get stuck again.  I can't sacrifice fashion just for drinks."""""""
Four,"I stopped by Apparel Pro this morning to pick up some new scrubs, and I was pleasantly surprised with the quantity of stock they had on hand (although they were out of tops in the size/color/style I was looking for), and the level of service they provided.  \n\nWhen I entered the store a young lady greeted me and asked what I was looking for.  She walked me to the product and showed me the different options available.  She also asked where I worked and told me that they offered a discount (a great one!) to people who work from my employer. \n\nThere is an awesome selection of petite and tall scrub bottoms.  They had every brand of scrubs I know of and any color you could possibly want.  There were fewer prints available than I anticipated, but I can't wear prints anyway, so I didn't mind.  There also is a clearance section and everything is $5!"
Four,Fresh Sea Food is what makes a sea food restaurant in the desert.  Salt Cellar has created a science that allows them to have such a unique menu.  If your looking for large lobsters by the lb then you have to check this place out.  I rationalize a heavy purchase of a lobster when I share it with someone and still have more than 2 lbs on my plate.  \n\nThe Salt Cellar is one of the only fine dinning experience that is open late.
One,"I'm so excited about the uprising of local restaurants downtown that I decided to try out the newest addition.  I went with 3 other people, and none of us will ever be back!  As HORRIBLE as the food was, I have never received such horendous customer service!  Our server was Kendyl.  She not only has no idea what is served in her establishment, she has no idea what customer service truly is.  At one point, she apologized for her attitude by telling us that she was tired because she works two jobs and she didn't get enough sleep the night before.  Not only is that not my fault, it shouldn't be my problem.  Our greeting took forever, our ordering was drawn out due to her back-and-forth to the kitchen to ask questions, our drinks were wrong (3 times), our food was wrong and missing items, and then our check took forever because she had to get an item removed.  We were one of only three tables in this restaurant on a Saturday morning.  There were numerous servers, baristas/bartenders, and even a manager, not only roaming around the restaurant but leaning on the host stand with nothing to do.  Is it that hard for the manager (who stood out like a sore thumb) to do a table touch with the three tables in his establishment?!?!?!  Not only will I never visit this restaurant again, but I will try to disuade everyone I can from going.  If I could rate lower than one star I would!"
Five,"I got a haircut yesterday by Alyse, and I actually woke up this morning thinking that my hair still looks great. Ive seen lots of hair stylists in LA, NYC, and in town and Alyse gave the best haircut and service I have seen in awhile. She is easy to chat with, offers great advice, and seems to actually enjoy her work.\n\nI loved the location and setting as it seems much more laid back and personable than your average salon. I look forward to having Alyse cut my hair in the future."
Five,I have eaten here twice so far and definitely plan to return soon. The Diablo Shrimp pizzadilla is excellent as is Cochinita Pibil which is a melt in your mouth slow roasted pork with a delicious deep flavored red sauce served with plantains and pickled red onions. A surprise on the menu for me was the cauliflower potato cake which was flavorful and filling. The flan and gelato are wonderful. The flan is huge and comes out on a diner plate so be ready ! Try this place the service is friendly and the ambiance is relaxed and warm - definitely a great place for a date!\n\nP.S. You can watch the tortillas being made fresh... and definitely taste the difference!
One,"""We had our company Christmas Party there.  Before closing, the staff turned the lights out over half our table.  The darkness was so overwelming, that we all forgot what we were even talking about.  When we were leaving our ruined party, we spoke to the staff about this.  They responded that \we all have families to go home to.\""""  They don't care about their customers' experiences there.  I will never go there again.  Not even an \""""I'm sorry!\"""" from them."""""""
Five,"""You know how some people say that those little mom & pops \hole-in-the-wall\"""" restaurants make the best food? Well, this is THAT place. Seriously, words can't express how much I love pupusas, and choices are limited here in Phoenix, but this place does it right. For those of you who have never had one, it's like a thick homeade tortilla stuffed with cheese and pork- or whatever you choose as the filling, then topped with this pickled cabbage/onion/carrot mixture. Amazing. Pupusas are only around 2 bucks each, and you only need 2 or 3 to fill you up. \nCome check this place out- I know I'll be back soon."""""""
Five,"Today is a historic day (9/9/09)!  After 28 years, Don and Charlie's opened for lunch.   I was not disappointed.  They are serving lunch from 11:30am until 2p in the bar.\n\nThere was a great selection of hamburgers and chicken sandwiches.  As always, the food was superb and the service (with Cooper) was even better.  The prices are more than reasonable for a big,  juicy hamburger.\n\nFor the record, on this inaugural day, I had a cheeseburger with bacon and grilled onions, no bun, a few cheese fries, dill pickle and creamy coleslaw.  \n\nIt does not get much better than that!"
Two,"""This was my first experience at North Mountain and it could have been better.  We recently relocated to Phoenix and decided to venture to North Mountain with our 2 dogs for a nice hike one evening.  \n\nPerhaps we didn't choose the best trailhead.  I'm definitely willing to go back and give it another shot since many other people in the area love it here.  We parked at the main entrance right off 7th at Peoria.  Having lived in the midwest for a while (and longing for mountains and open sky of the west) we were excited to have a potential hiking spot so nearby.    \n\nI'm not exactly sure what trail we were on but we headed north....north in to a sea of broken glass.  Broken glass everywhere!  I was amazed at how much there was and wondered where it all could have come from.  We had to be very careful navigating through it with our dogs.  However sparkly and shimmery the glass was in the setting sunlight, \plentiful shards of glass\"""" is not something I look for in a good hike.  \n\nNow I will say that as we headed north it got much better.  Eventually we landed upon another trailhead.  After looking at a map we determined it was one off N Central.  I think next time we'll start from there and hopefully  can add another star or two to this review."""""""
Five,"What can you say about a place that hits all the right notes?  It is charming...funky...cool...fun.  There are several rooms and within those rooms, nooks and crannies so you can choose solitude or conviviality, depending on your mood.   \n\nThe food is A+++++.   All the old favorites are there -- great coffee and melt-in-your-mouth pastries.   I personally have only been there for coffee...yet.    But I heard ooooohs and ahhhhhhs over the rest of the menu items.   You know it's good when people are planning what they will have on their next visit before they have even finished their meal.\n\nThere is a bar now and what looks like a very well chosen wine collection.   Enjoy!!!!"
Four,"I'll be honest, the food was so good I ate here twice in one day. Very simple, clean, but elegant pairings with the freshest ingredients around. I had the edamame dumplings and the farmer's market salad for lunch. The dumplings were more like ravioli with a bit of truffle oil - some of the best I've had. I really would have been happy with an entire plate of these for my meal! The salad was fresh and crisp, and an interesting combination of ingredients - golden beets, kale, romaine, manchego cheese, avocado, with a light champagne vinagerette. \n\nLater, I ordered the thai dumplings and steelhead salmon for dinner. The dumplings were good, but not as good as the edamame dumplings from lunch. The salmon was cooked perfectly - good sear on the outside, and moist on the inside - all on top of a bed of beets, greens, and red quinoa. \n\nPrice is a bit of a drawback here, but I suppose you pay for what you get when it comes to the calibur of the ingredients. I don't live in AZ, but a True Food just opened in Denver where I live - can't wait to get back here."
Two,"We've been going to Valle Luna on and off for years.  \n\nThe last time that we ate there, we were less than pleased.  The food was bland, the sauces all tasted the same.  I ordered tamales, my favorite, they were as hard as rocks, so dense and heavy and unpleasant.  The rice was blah.\n\nMy daughter decided that rather than order from the kids meal, she would order a 1/2 price happy hour appetizer.  The happy hour was standing up in the middle of the table for all to see.  When we tried to order off the appetizer menu, we were told that those items could only be ordered in the bar and that the server was unable to accomodate us.  I decided to go into the bar and order the appetizer to bring back to our table.  On the upside, the bartender was very helpful and said that it was fine, nothing worng with bringing it back to our table and then offered to bring it to us when it was done!  So helpful!  Less than disappointed that the server was so unwilling to help us solve the problem.  \n\nWe went home with tons of leftovers because none of us thought the food was any good.  Don't know why we took it home, it just ended up in the trash. \n\nI guess we'll continue our quest to find the best Mexican food restaurant!"
Two,"My meal here was just OK.  There were a few people in line in front of us, but we waited almost 15 minutes to place our order.  Not sure why it took so long.  At least our food was quickly brought to our table.\n\nThere's only one vegetarian option on the menu, which is not ideal.  It was OK, but it seemed like there were an awful lot of bean sprouts in it and not as many noodles as I would have liked.  I quickly finished the noodles and was left with a bowl full of broth and sprouts.  There were just a few small slices of tofu...disappointing for sure.\n\nWe also ordered a smoothie, and we waited about 25 minutes for it, longer than it took us to finish our meal.  We ended up taking it with us.  They said it took so long because it took a long time to make the boba, but we ordered ours without boba, and I guess it didn't occur to them to make ours first since they could do it right away.\n\nThe restaurant was clean and the food was pretty good, but overall not a satisfying experience.  I'll probably try it again when they've had longer to get their act together."
Five,"""It doesn't even seem right that I have never reviewed this place, as I've been coming to and raving about \The Parilla\"""" for going on 7 years now.  It is my de facto \""""friends in town and want some good Mexican\"""" stop.  In fact, I'm freakin' shocked by the low ratings this place is getting!!\n\nAs with anyone Mexican place, they start you out with chips and awesome salsa.  There's a spicy smooth red sauce, a pico-type salsa, and the piece de resistance....the avocado tomatillo salsa.  They do, however, charge for extra chips/salsa after the first freebie refill.\n\nI recommend anyone try the Tortilla Soup (note: NOT a chicken tortilla soup).  You can get with or without toppings of sour cream and avocado for an additional cost, but I find it perfect as is.  It's mostly broth with cheese and tortilla strips (of course), but it is just such a delish soup. For my entree, I always get #25, which is a vegetarian combo of a tamale and cheese enchilada, which I have them use mole sauce instead of traditional enchilada sauce.  It comes with refried beans (the pinto beans are cooked with pork) and rice.  The soup and this plate are MORE than enough for dinner and breakfast/lunch the next day.\n\nThey have several other locations in the Valley, a few in Tucson, one in Guadalajara, and one in Mexico City."""""""
Two,"""We live in Litchfield Park, but took the trip to Scottsdale based on this place's reputation. The building and decor are super nice in a throwback Spanish mission sort of way. The separate \tequilleria\"""" and patio are attention getting. since it was 119 degrees, we sat inside. \n\nThat is where the fun ended. \n\nWe ordered chips and salsa for $5. No big deal, but where else do you pay for that in any sit down joints anymore? They do bring out fresh tortillas, gratis, but we didn't know that and it's not mentioned on the menu.\n\nThe menu is pretty limited and oh so pricey. $15.00 for two a la cart tacos. Holey Moley, they better be stuffed with caviar. There is no taco on the planet worth $7.50 (maybe worth $7 :-)) and I have had some great tacos. These are not those tacos.\n\nThe fish tacos were under seasoned portions of Mahi Mahi. The fish itself was not seasoned at all and actually had a fishy taste. Not pleasant. It was served with radishes rather than coleslaw which was interesting and the crema which was tasty. But as a whole, it was bland and underwhelming even after adding the accompanying sauce.\n\nWe also had the bacon wrapped spicy meatloaf on garlic mashed potatoes. Served with a zippy red pepper sauce and tree trunk sized asparagus. The sauce was very tasty, the meatloaf was tender and not  dry. There was something so rich in the meatloaf itself, that after 3/4 of one slice, I couldn't eat anymore of it. It just began to turn my stomach. The potatoes were cooked really well and had some nice flavor, but needed salt. That was funny, because there was no salt on the table. The asparagus was well cooked and still had some snap, but like the potatoes, it was under seasoned.\n\nWe ordered the banana stuffed fried tortilla in blackberry reduction and were disappointed there too. The tortillas were overstuffed with banana, so that you couldn't enjoy the crunchy texture of the cinnamon crusted tortilla. It just became mush. The reduction was not \""""reduced\"""" and was runny, but tasty. \n\nFor three of us, the tab totaled over $85 before tip. That included 2 bud lights, which WERE cold and refreshing. \n\nAll said, the environment is far more interesting than the food. The place's reputation is undeserved at half the price!"""""""
Four,"For those of you that don't realize... Buca's is a franchise resturant. I found my first Buca's back home in PA and was pleasently surprised at the food. I am a bit fussy about eating Italian out especially when it comes to red sauce. I like my gravy SMOOTH! Not chunky. My german girlfriend on the other hand loves chunky gravy. The amount of food you get is amazing and a small entree can surely be shared by 2 people so don't let the prices scare you. We ordered chicken carbanara white is in an alfredo style sauce with peas, panchetta bacon, chicken and proschuitto. She got a side of marinara which was some what chunky but not quite as spicey as she likes. But overall the meal was delicious to me even though the bacon was not panchetta. We also had Italian wedding soup which was NOT traditional but was equally delicious! They added roasted red peppers to it to spice it up and it was really good plus the bowl was HUGE! We finished off with an order of tiramisu which was very good also and was enough to feed 5 or 6, it was literally the size of a 8 or 9 inch pie!!! This is pretty good Italian food served just like your grandmother would have done... Enouth to feed a batallion of Marines! Two iced teas, two bowls of soup, one small entree and one dessert... $45.00. Our waitress Suzanna was very nice and did a wonderful job! You won't go wrong here unless your too picky when it comes to your gravy! LOL!"
Four,"""If you're from the East Coast, this'll remind of you of home.  If you're not, you are not only less predisposed to drop the term \wicked\"""" at inappropriate times, you have no idea what kind of place this is.  Allow me to help explain it to you.\n\nIf there's one thing The Mustache loves, it is truth in advertising.  This joint calls itself Five Guys Burgers and Fries, and that's pretty much all you get.  They do have hot dogs and the like, but this place isn't called Five Guys Hot Dogs and Stuff, so why would you order such a thing?!  \n\nThe basic burger is a 2-patty model, you'll have to ask for the Junior Burger if one patty is all you'd like.  Toppings are ordered individually, and can be ordered on the side if you'd like to pack 'em on yourself.  If you are here at peak times, expect a line to the door (or even outside) and a pretty thorough hunt for a chair.\n\nYou'll have to wait a while here, which is made more difficult when you realize you're faced with watching them make your delicious burger right in front of you.  In an off-peak time I once received my burger in 10 minutes, but the average seems to be longer than that.  You have plenty of time to fetch your own drink, look for a chair that suits your fancy, and listen to the music.\n\nThat's right, music.  Burger joints don't tend to blare music anymore.  At Five Guys, you'll enjoy your favorite classic rock tunes as you dine.  That adds an element of fun to the atmosphere, which is already pretty laid-back.\n\nPeanuts are stacked in boxes that separate the ordering area from the dining area, and the shells litter the floor at times.  Use caution while walking through the dining area for that very reason.  If you have a peanut allergy, you'll want to use extreme care to limit your exposure.  If you're a vegetarian, the peanuts are just about all you can eat here, so enjoy them in multitude!\n\nWhen your number is called, your burger is served to you in a paper bag that also contains your fries if you ordered them.  A trick I like to use is removing everything from the bag, cutting it open, and dumping the fries onto it.  You'll quickly learn why...the bag absorbs at least some of the ample grease held inside the fries.  They are also cooked skin-on, which is an acquired taste for many.  You can order them Cajun Style, I found that to be overwhelming and have not ordered them that way since.  Lightly salted is perfect.\n\nThe burgers themselves are phenomenal.  Well-cooked and a perfect mate to the cheese melting atop it.  Lettuce is crisp and not overwhelming, you're not going to get the feeling that you're biting into a lettuce head each time.\n\nSo why not 5-stars?  Others have alluded to this...it is pricey for what you get.  The food is great, the ambiance is good, the staff is cheerful, but you're paying a lot for that when you can go down the road to In 'n Out Burger and pay a few bucks less for something almost as good.  That's going to be a personal decision, and I've already heard of wars breaking out between the Five Guys and In 'n Out camps.  Pretty wicked indeed."""""""
Five,"*This review is for a Tuesday evening*\n\nMade my first visit tonight with some co-workers, and everything I had heard about 5th & Wine was true. Clean, unique establishment w/ good service and great ambience. Their BBQ wings came highly recommended, and I'm not a big wings guy, but goddamn... they were AMAZING: flavorful, meaty wings that seemed to be cooked perfectly. I seriously couldn't get enough of them. Their garlic fries were also great, as was my caesar salad. My Stella came out with a nice ice cold pint glass. They have a pretty extensive food and wine menu, but not overwhelming. Their Elk burger caught my eye while scanning the menu, so I have a good reason to go back."
Four,"My wife and I enjoyed our Saturday night dinner at My Big Fat Greek Restaurant. This place has ample space on the patio along with strategic placement of the heat lamps. We opted to eat outside on a chilly evening while about 95% of the other diners where inside. So we basically had the gorgeous patio to ourselves and had a great time.\n\nOur server was attentive, although a little too heavy on the upsells. My wife had the Pork Souvlaki which consisted of 2 skewers, house salad and rice. I sampled the skewers and can vouch that they tasted excellent. I had the Lamb Shank in what seemed to be cooked in a tomatoe type sauce along with sliced zucchini and squash with potatoes and a few pitas. I enjoyed my meal. Not the best tasting lamb I have ever had, but enough to get the job done. Our meal was about $40 before tip."
Four,"After a refreshing hike up Squaw Peak, we ended up at Da Vang for some pho lovin'.  And pho lovin' is what we received.\n\nIt's kind of in a ghetto area (no surprise!) and the inside is pretty bland like any authentic Asian restaurant worth their salt should be.\n\nThe food, however, was the exact opposite!  I ordered the #2, a big heaping bowl of pho complete with an assortment of meats, and we shared two orders of spring rolls (two in each order).  We were relieved that the orders came out quick, because the lot of us were thirsty and/or hungry, and we wanted to get down to business.\n\nBoth the pho and the spring rolls were equally as tasty.  Although I didn't finish the pho (strictly due to not being hungry enough to finish the whole thing), I was glad that my friends chose this place as our destination.\n\nThey also have banh mi (2.50 each...cheap!), which my friend said was also pretty good.  So you have your choice of noodles, sandwiches or rice dishes here.  Apparently they also serve boba drinks next door.  You can order the drinks at Da Vang and they'll bring them over to you, but if the boba place is closed, then you're out of luck (like we were, but I'm not gonna hold it against them)."
Two,"If you visit the Sandbar and you are not a Scottsdale local you will be convinced that breast implants are a requirement for working there. Every bartender/waitress seemed to have implants. To add to that, across me ther was a young girl having the following conversation with some cougar: \n\nYoung Girl: Yeah, my doctor was awesome.\nCougar: Oh yeah?\nYoung girl: yeah, he made them completely natural\nCougar: oh.....\nYoung Girl: You should totally get some...\nCougar: yeah, I've thought about...\nYoung Girl: here, let me give you his card\n\nSo in other words... if you like breast implants visit the Sandbar. As far as the food...who knows, who cares?"
Five,"This review is a long time coming. Fortunately, it's been a long time since I've been in an accident. But three times in the past eight years, I've been involved in collisions that caused some major body damage to my cars. I took them to Kales twice, and I'm happy that i did. \n\nI originally went back in 2004 on the recommendation of my roommate at the time. I was rear-ended and pushed into the car in front of me (causing a lot of damage to both ends). While the service on my old 2002 Civic was slow, the workmanship was great. The car ran like new when I finally got it back. \n\nLast year, the door of my 2008 Mazda 3 was badly sideswiped. I got my car back in a little less than a week, and it was in pristine shape. The manager also took the time to cut off an old security tag on my key which I had been too lazy to take back to the dealer to have removed. (A nice little touch). \n\nKale's works easily with State Farm Insurance. The people there are friendly and explain every detail about the work that went into the repair (half the terms flew way over my head). I hope to never have to take my car back to Kales. But if I do get into another crash, I'm going straight there!"
One,"Why would a person want to go into a place where they virtually never get your order right.  How does an order for 2 large pomegranate smoothies with wheat grass blended in become half a banana with a side of wheat grass and a small pomegranate smoothie with a side of wheat grass?  What is worse when the fellow making the order argues with you that the order is right and you are wrong?  This is typical of the place.  A friend likes to go in there or they'd never see me again.  I make them read back what I order or they don't get my AMEX,   You can make then print out an itemized receipt.  I'd suggest it.   In all fairness, I can tell you they have gotten my order correct one and a half times.  That's not saying much is it.\n\nThe company could also spend a little money on some sound proofing this place.  I agree with Nadia C, with all the mixers going and the music, it's not some place you want to be for long.  But, they could spend the money to train their staff to learn how to ring orders properly, so making the place a little more quiet obviously is wishful thinking.\n\nThe parking leaves a lot to be desired now that the Verizon office is a few doors down from them.  You'd better be fast when there is an empty spot or it can really become ugly.\n\nThe best thing I can say for the place is they have good oatmeal.\n\nI have truly enjoyed writing this review!\n\nIf you really want a much better smoothie go to Robeks on the NE corner of 16th and Camelback,  It's cleaner, nicer set up, and they have a magic ability to get your order right."
Five,"The food here is amazing, try the Machaca beef tacos, I prefer them with no garnish.  This is another real authentic Mexican food place in the Phoenix Metro area that has quality Mexican food at a great price.  It is very clean, fast and the people are friendly.  They have delivery for a small area in south scottsdale, but the amunt of time it takes them to get your house kinda reuins the food (soggy taco shells).  BUT I still give them 5 stars!"
Five,"I knew things were going to be good when I valeted my old Jeep Cherokee before going into here. I was expecting pretty great things and I wasn't disappointed. \n\nI love some good wine and I realized that a lot of other people in Phoenix feel the same. Postino was packed...I mean packed! I did not expect to get the quality service that I did because I assumed that the staff would be overwhelmed. This was not the case. The service, recommendations and the bruschetta were all fantastic! Though a friendly and energetic woman named Maya was my server, I was helped by a total of four people without solicitation (while the place was still slammed with customers). The whole staff was super welcoming and really made me feel like they enjoyed what they were doing.\n\n If I wore a hat, it would be off to this place. Go here!"
Four,"Hubby and I went here for lunch today and enjoyed it very much. We ordered a salad and fried okra to go along with the meal\n  I had the Southern Pork Chop, mashed potatoes, corn, biscuits and gravy( I make better biscuits) and hubby had the Chicken Fry, which he brought half of home with us.\nThe pork chop was tender and juicy and almost fork tender, I ate all of it, left most of  the mashed potatoes and the corn, probably because we ate the salad and the okra first.\nI like the inside although it is a little dark, very kitchy with all the license plates from all over.\nI say go, eat, waddle home...it is worth it and it is great comfort food!"
Three,"I went to OHSO with a large group of friends and we were seated really quickly even though the place was packed.  The ambiance is great.  The only reason why I gave it 3 stars was because I've been twice and wasn't extremely impressed with the food.  I'm a vegetarian and loved the fact that they have a veggie burger.  The burger was good, not amazing.  Another time I ordered some type of flat bread pizza which wasn't great.  One of my friends had the pulled pork and he LOVED it."
Four,"""Great customer service, perfect dining area! This lightly dimmed pizzeria is nothing like the other high top table pizza places, the staff and waitress' are really friendly with along great customer service! (and I am picky with people who serve at restaurants!) this place is great for family or even with friends to get a great bite to eat. I ordered the side \Chef Eric's Caesar salad and thin crust cheese with pepperoni\"""" I highly recommend For GREAT pizza! However the guy who was going to bring my pizza dropped it...but made it up by giving me Nicole's Notable Chocolate Chip cookies :)"""""""
Four,"This is a great new neighborhood place and worth visiting.  All fresh ingredients, not pre-cooked.  All the servers are friendly and knowledgeable about the the menu - ask them why each item was named the way it was.  It may be empty at times, but then come at 10am on a Sunday!  \n\nOur only complaint is that the menu is set, we couldn't get a make your own omelet.... which is really a bummer at a breakfast spot.  Hopefully they'll change that.\n\nWe have eaten here twice for breakfast and once for lunch and looking forward to going back soon.\n\nFinally, it's not a cheap place, but not overpriced either.  Reasonable value for what you're getting, and that's fair."
Five,"""Just got back from the Fairmont Scottsdale, spent three nights there and ate at the Bourbon Steak all three nights.  Let's get to it:\n\nDay 1: Plane touches down at 6:30 p.m.   The wife tells me there is some sort of happy hour half-price deal so we need to get on the foot to get there quick.  Somewhere en route I get out of her that's it's just half price cocktails with purchase of a hamburger but hey, that's still a deal.  We get to the hotel a little after 7 and send the bags to the room to head to Bourbon straightaway.  Sat at the bar and had a really good hamburger.  The fries are $5 on the bar menu but are well worth it, mmm...fat.  I have two Rogue Dead Guy ales and....hey what's the alcohol content on those? Wait, I have the internet, I'll look it up....I'm being told it's 6.5% which explains the quickly ensuing buzz...also got the red onion rings which were beautifully stacked and all perfectly coated with goodness.  Winner.\n\nDay 2: The wife has never seen the Grand Canyon so we take a 13 hour van trip through Sedona and the park.  The canyon remains impressive.  Get back to the hotel at 8:30'ish and decide to forego any more car time and go back to Bourbon, again in the bar, this time at a table.  Feeling like I'm on dangerous ground from a culinary-responsibility angle I have the salmon-burger 'banh-mi' style.  My request for 'as rare as they will make it' is heeded with remarkable sincerity and the fish comes out virtually raw which is fine by me.  A repeat of the fries and the onion rings.  Feel guilty about it until the first bite at which point I feel awesome about it.  Two more of those Rogue's now knowing full well the likely effect.  Tonight the service is spotty bordering on lousy and the two tables next to us almost riot.\n\nDay 3: All day at the pool (4th of July!).  My pool bar tab: 12 Coronas at 6 bucks per and two hot dogs at a felonious 9 apiece, an even 90 (and my mother's heart sinks somewhere for a reason she can't put her finger on).  Tonight we have an actual reservation so we go back again, this time for a full dinner.  Echoing many other reviews, the lighting in the dining room is atrocious and, for some reaon, there are a ton of people sitting down to dinner at 9:30 with their mo-fo 10 year olds.  Strange, and also lame.  There are, however, a couple good booths in the bar which are not floodlit, to one of these we decamp.  The wife tells the wait person about the previous night's crappy service which she (the wait person) takes to heart as the service was an A+.  Tonight, ordering off the dinenr menu, the fries are free (word).  The soft-shelled crab tempura, ahi-poke, wedge salad, hanger steak, and marrow bones are not.  They split both the steak and the salad for us very nicely which was a nice touch.  The meal was delicious.  I like the food here.  I tell the server, \the food is really rich here\"""".\n\nDay 4: I was on the treadmill for five miles watching the Wimbledon final and was really sweaty and thought I smelled duck fat but that might have been my imagination.  Anyhoo, as I write this I now remember I took one of the after-dinner caramels back to our room and packed it in my suitcase which I unpacked this morning (but missed the side pocket) so there's a caramel in the luggage closet.  I will forget this by 7 p.m. tonight and will therefore discover this caramel near Labor Day when I next likely need that duffell.  Alas, I digress."""""""
Three,"I am used to some good coffee roasters in L.A. so I am a little picky.  It was o.k., but nothing above average.  Latte art - check, nice Scottsdale Quarter mall - check, great taste -  meh....could be better,  friendly employees - check.  Not sure where roasting is done because I could not see it or smell it on the premises.  I did not feel an indie/hipster vibe as Jessica M. stated.  It seemed like run of the mill Starbucks to me."
Five,"great service!\n\ni brought my company here for a happy hour, and i knew it would be packed.  so i called ahead, and the hostess reserved us a table for 6.  when i got there, the table was all ready for us.  terrific scratch made drinks and happy hour food.  we had margaritas made with herradura, my favorite tequila.  the apps are a cut above your normal bar food; the wings are perfect.  everyone loved it..\n\nive had dinner here a few times as well, and i always find it a great value for the level of service and quality of food.  great consistency each time.  will bring everyone back soon."
Five,"A couple times a week, I go to a gym right next to Joe's Real BBQ, and I'm so thankful I'm a vegetarian because the smell coming from their smoker would undo my entire workout otherwise.\n\nSo am I qualified to review Joe's even though I abstain from meat? Absolutely. I ate many meaty meals at Joe's in my teens and 20s. I actually worked there when I was a senior in high school, and I managed to gain the freshman 15 before starting college.\n\nBack in the day, my favorite was the turkey breast. I dare you to find a more moist piece of white meat. Runner-up was the pulled pork, mostly because I loved to smother it in pickles and marinated onions. I'm not gonna lie; my mouth is watering just thinking about the condiments. My best friend, a North Carolina native, loves their pulled pork because they toss it in a vinegar-based sauce in true NC style. My husband and his friends all go gaga over the ribs, and brisket seems to be a crowd pleaser.\n\nNowadays, I stick with the side dishes. I love the cheesy potatoes (add scallions and douse in green tabasco) and mac and cheese. The apple sauce, potato salad, and cole slaw are all items I'm not normally a fan of, but at Joe's they are way above average and very delicious.\n\nThe restaurant has a great atmosphere. It's a great place to take kids, large groups, and out of towners. It is spotlessly clean too. A pharmacy school classmate used to do restaurant inspections, and she said Joe's was always immaculate. Service is wonderful too. It says a lot about a restaurant when employees have stayed 10+ years.\n\nOn another note, I would encourage anyone who needs a caterer to consider Joe's Real BBQ. Everyone will love it, and their rates are very affordable. I used them for my wedding and a housewarming party. Just last week, they catered my sister's wedding, and they really went above and beyond for her to make sure her day went smoothly. Keeping her happy was no small feat!"
Four,"Half Price Books is a thrift store and gift shop rolled into one. If you ever needed a birthday or Christmas idea, they have so many things in the front that are interesting and different, not always books, but novelty items. The staff is friendly. I hope to have my new poetry book in their stores. It's a discount bookstore, like Bookman's but with a cleaner look to it. They also have a good selection of music. It's quiet. I gave it four stars only because the only thing it's missing is a coffee shop, like Tempe Library or Bookman's on Country Club."
Four,"In town for Spring Training, a friend and I stumbled in here after checking into our nearby hotel. It is a spacious restaurant with a nice front patio. The only thing that struck me as odd was it was dead at 9pm on a Friday night. Is this just a Scottsdale thing? Do people eat at 5 and go to bed? Weird. Anyhoo, the food! We each ordered a chicken wrap sandwich. It was delicious. Chicken, creamy chipotle mayo, bacon and lettuce. Absolutely scrumptious. Another plus was their happy hour... the margaritas were $5! Awesome deal and quite tasty. Our wrap came with sweet potato fries that were perfection. I would definitely go back here again when in town."
Two,"""My boyfriend and I were very disappointed by this restaurant. We expected to be impressed, and simply were not. This place does not live up to its hype. \n\nWe came here for a birthday dinner, and I had a certificate for a free Beef Medallions with Shrimp Scampi. We also ordered the Brio Chopped salad and Calamari. \n\nThe salad was delicious, but we weren't impressed by much else. The calamari was tasteless to say the least. The beef medallions were not cooked to our preference- we ordered them medium rare and they came out well done. The \shrimp scampi\"""" was about 3 shrimp on top of the medallions, all sitting on a bed of orzo pasta and small pieces of roasted vegetables tossed in a sauce. \n\nWe were just so disappointed. I would suggest going somewhere else."""""""
Five,"darkish lighting, church pews (first time i actually didnt mind sitting in a church pew), tables made of doors with glass over them, and good music. this place does a great job of setting a comfy and relaxing atmosphere right from the get go. be aware that seating is first come first serve so if you want one of the roomy booths outside, you'll have to go during the weekday or get there early on a Friday night and stake your claim. they fill up rather fast.\n\nservice was great. everyone was extremely friendly and our waitress was totally attentive. she was really patient as we picked through the menu and tried to decide what tastiness to eat. oh and did i mention that rather decent selection of beers and a cider or two? yeah, that. soooo delicious. i did see only one local beer on tap (Kiltlifter) but it didnt disturb me too much since i saw quite a few delicious Belgian and German beers. don't get me wrong, i'm all for local but i can be swayed by supreme tastiness. \n\ni had the meat and cheese pasty, our friend had the philly cheese steak, and the boyfriend had the vindaloo. surprisingly the vindaloo did not suck. i dug the peas and the moist chicken. my meat and cheese was awesome. i mean c'mon, its meat and cheese. the sausage had a great sage-y taste to it and the cheese was uber melty. the philly cheese steak tasted EXACTLY like a delicious cheese steak from philly. \n\nall in all, this might become my new haunt. i saw that they had great brunch specials and lots of mimosas/beer. how could i NOT come back?"
Five,"Great pizza - I always add garlic which makes every pizza even more AWESOME! I prefer to order carry out - sometimes the delivery takes too long when they get busy and you end up with cold pizza, which still tastes great (and not rubbery like those places that use cheap imitation cheese blends) but when you order fresh pizza, eating it hot is just sort of an expectation! If you keep your eyes peeled you can usually find killer deals in the coupon mailer, the Arcadian, and even on Groupon!"
Five,"""This was my first time hear, had no idea what to order, so I asked the waitress.  I went with all her recommendations and it couldn't have been better.  Started off with the \wedge\"""" salad, which I have never been a fan of wedge salads, but I ate every last bit.  The bacon and blue cheese dressing were enough to make me want to like my plate clean.  Then had the Porcini Rubbed Delmonico with 12-year aged Balsamic and the mac and cheese.\n\nIf you go you HAVE to have the Mac and Cheese with Lobster, it is to die for!  My boyfriend kept raving about it, and to be honest I didn't really believe him.  Not until I took that first bite, I was done for!  All the flavors just melt in your mount and bland into this amazing deliciousness, really it's that good."""""""
Three,"I like 'Dive Bars' - there I said it. It may be a reflection of my early years when my sainted father was a bartender in some of the bast parts of Chicago, but I kinda like this local dive. So, Ladies, this is not a place you might want to go to alone, bring a friend, or three. Drinks are cheap, people are very interesting, service was fast and the pool tables weren't too shabby at all. I have never had an issue with violence, real or imaginary, but I have only been here a few times in the recent past."
Four,Being from NJ I am always on the prowl for my hometown pizza and Italian food. They have absolutely the best cannolis like my grandmothers!  The pizza droops like Ray's Pizza in NY. I'm not a big fan of sauce that has any sugar in it which most do so to many their sauce is awesome. I prefer unsweetened everything.\n\nThe service is great and they are from New Jersey!  It's a great place to grab their special 2 slices and a coke for $4! YUM!
Three,"The ever evolving menu changes again, But a coupon made it a decent buy.\n\nI will admit my co workers 2 for 1 coupon is why we went in. This means ~3.25 per burrito vs the usual $6 range.\n\nWhat I didn't like was that my vegetarian burrito did not have vegetables in it, it was just a bean and rice burrito with guacamole. I don't know how one gets the grilled veggies in their burrito but it is not by ordering a vegetarian burrito.\n\nThe drink and napkin station here has always been a bottleneck, getting a refill or more napkins is nearly impossible.\n\nI do like the fact there there is Choula sauce in addition to the red and green tobascos. And I also like that the chairs are not nearly as bad as those at chipotle.\n\nThe best tip this time is get in before 12, otherwise be prepared for a long long line."
One,"I sadly, have to update my review and pan this place.\n\nI had an appointment for today, and I was kept waiting 25 minutes.  Then, when my girl finally got around to me, about 5 minutes into my service, she stopped, and said she had a quick manicure she had to do. (!!).  I was beside myself.  I was ready to bolt, but was halfway though a pedicure!  \n\nYes, the work is great, but the customer service is pathetic.  I think what they do is just take everyone who either calls, or walks in the door.  Then they make everyone wait.\n\nWhen you live in a city with a nail salon every 20 feet, this isn't the way you build a customer base. If I walked in (as I did for my first service), I'd expect to wait.  But to have an appointment, be kept waiting almost 30 minutes, then have the person up and take someone else in the MIDDLE is just atrocious.\n\nThey lost me as a customer for good."
Three,"Made a recent trip to Nello's Pizza while at work.  The place has a nice atmosphere, with comfortable seating.  We were helped as soon as we walked up to the to go counter.  The gentleman who took our order was extremely friendly (as were the rest of the employees).  Prices were reasonable, I think we paid somewhere around $11 for a large pizza.  The gentleman who took our order told us it would be about ten minutes (it ended up taking 20). \n\nI must say I wasn't terribly impressed with the pizza.  It was pretty good, but Nello's pizza didn't really distinguish itself from any of the hundreds of other pizza places in the Valley.  In my opinion the crust was mediocre, and there was WAY too much sauce. \n\nPROS: \nReasonable prices\nComfortable atmosphere\nFamily owned local business\n\nCONS: \nToo much sauce\nCrust is just okay\nTook longer than expected to get our food\n\nBOTTOM LINE:\nI'd eat at Nello's again if I were in the area, but there are certainly better choices for pizza in the Valley."
Two,"I have generally had great experiences with the Fox Restaurants - not so this time.  Hubby and I dropped in on a Friday night (not many people there).  We sat on the patio where the misters are impressive I must say.  I ordered the Sangria - a big why bother and not worth the calories.  Then my fish tacos arrived. . . meh - just nothing exciting, I can whip up better ones at home without even trying.  The beans - not tasty (read boring) and the rice would pass for a dessert.  For a town that has a lot of Southwestern / Mexican  type restaurants one has to be on their game to do well in that genre.  This one is definitely not in the game.  Servers were good though it was like we had 2 and they neither one knew the other one had us covered.  It was a bit like a comedy.  Next time we will keep on walking to another restaurant."
Two,"Andreoli, you disappoint me. Here's why...\nAfter not visiting you for nearly a year, I craved your food. Either you are resting on your laurels or stopped caring or both.\nWith crummy weather that we had today, a friend suggested your restaurant. Well other than the coffee that is consistently excellent, the pasta dish I ordered left everything to be desired...I ate because I was hungry but there was nothing in that dish worth recommending - dried pasta, uninteresting ragu - no sauce whatsoever....blah! \n\nSo much for driving 20 minutes to come see you, I'll stay home next time thinking of you and make my own meal and not spend $ 13 for a dish that's not even worth two bucks.\n\nOn top of that, you are too busy talking on the phone instead of taking care of your customers. Not even one person bothered to ask us how our food was."
Two,"I guess I just don't get it. \n\nI had to bring food to an obligatory breakfast potluck at work. Oh how I hate obligatory breakfast potlucks at work!  I was going to go to Sprouts and pick something up on my way in, but I did not realize they didn't open till 8AM.\n\nI saw the new Krispy Kreme Doughnuts was open across the street, and I found a solution. There was a bit of a line, but nothing too bad. I got a mixed dozen. \n\nI ate one of their donuts, and it pretty much grossed me out. It was way too sweet in a gross way. I tried a different kind on another day from a box in the front office at work. Same thing, I threw it away after one bite. I do not get what is so great about these doughnuts.\n\nThere are a lot better ways for me to exceed my caloric limits. Krispy Kreme, I'll pass."
One,"Read some of the other reviews before going.  So many positives, I was really looking forward to trying this place, always hoping for a good sushi buffet, but always having been disappointed..\n\nFirst, the good stuff.  Lots of variety.  Very clean.  Staff is friendly and helpful without being obsequious.  \n\nBut ultimately, it's the food one goes to a restaurant for, and in this the place fails.  Food that should have been warm wasn't.  Sushi didn't look, taste, or have the texture of fresh.  Rolls mostly tasted the same - couldn't tell one from the other.  \n\nDesserts?  Again, lots of options, all mediocre.\n\nFelt it was really a waste of money.  Won't be back."

Five,"We stumbled across this place while looking for some dog friendly breakfast joints in Scottsdale. Boy were we lucky to have found this hidden gem... And I do mean hidden gem as it's pretty difficult to find the first time. \n\nFirst off, their coffee bar menu gave us a great couple of options in the Mexican latte and smoca mocha. You can do any of them hot or cold and with the temps scorching in the summer, the iced versions were great. \n\nThe wife had a great mushroom omelet in a wine cream sauce and my green flannel (corned beef hash with chilies topped with sour cream) was fantastic. \n\nWe were fortunate to not run into any service issues as others have which meant that we were thoroughly satisfied with our experience here. \n\nI think we'll end up frequenting this place on our getaway trips out to Scottsdale."
Three,"""Slightly \off\"""". Cute place, decent menu, okay beer/wine list, meh ambiance, average service. The best analogy I can make is like a Roosevelt-lite. It's similarly decorated, similarly cramped, similarly styled, but not as good.\n\nI found nothing on the beer list that knocked my socks off. Heavy on the Four Peaks offerings, which is fine, but if I wanted some Four Peaks beer... I would just go. I felt the same about the wine list. The food menu manages to be small yet versatile at once -- more than one token vegetarian option, for example -- although I agree with the sentiment about lunch foods for dinner (as in: no). The grilled cheese has potential, although mine arrived slightly undercooked, flaccid, and room temperature in the middle. The side salad was awesome! Simplicity is sometimes a good thing in a salad. A generous amount of field greens with the perfect amount of some light lemony dressing -- just delicious. My SO had some turkey sandwich with jalapeno cream cheese that he seemed quite fond of. \n\nAfter the meh-ness of the beer and wine list, I was hoping to take advantage of the supposedly full bar. Coffee with Kahlua, Bailey's, anything like that? Um, no. The waitress (who would only deign to engage my SO with eye contact, preferring to stare at the floor when speaking to me) said some people have it with whiskey. Fine. The coffee wasn't super hot, and she never even asked about cream and sugar. \n\nWe shared the ice cream sampler -- one dish each of vanilla, stout, and salted caramel almond -- for dessert. The vanilla was excellent, with a rich malty finish. The stout, well, kind of reminded me of coffee (but delicious nonetheless). The salted caramel almond was too much of a good thing -- too much salt, too many nuts, too sweet, too much of a punch in the mouth. \n\nThe crowd was bizarre. We got there pretty early for a Saturday, 6 pm, and the place was packed! We were lucky to score a table amid the couples on dates and guys playing cards. By the time we finished up, the place was half-empty, leaving us next to the table full of loud chicks with a toddler. \n\nWill we be back? Well, probably - it's a stone's throw from home, and I'm curious to try the mac-and-cheese. Will it end up on the regular rotation list? Not so sure about that."""""""
Three,"Stopped in here for a quick lunch on the way to an event at West World. \n\nThe food and service were good, but not excellent. My friends and I each ordered a sandwich and some hummus to start. The thai hummus was pretty good and pretty spicy. I had the Southwest Burger which also had a good kick. The burger was pretty tasty. \n\nEveryone seems to rave about the beer, but maybe not the next visit when we don't have to return to work in the afternoon."
Four,"I love this place even though I live in Gilbert; few Indian places at all in Gilbert. Will usually stop by when I go to Trader Joe's and get the chicken tikka kebab, thali style - that's enough for 2 meals for me.

Two,"""I've been to three Pizza Picazzo locations, and this one absolutely blew,. The reason? Service with a capital S. I invited a very large group out to lunch (made reservations the day before).

Finally, the husband and I had way too busy of a schedule to go out to eat or to even make dinner at home so I picked up a piece of sausage lasagna and some garlic mashed potatoes here.\n\nOnce I got home and reheated my food I nestled up on the couch to eat and watch Judge Judy.  I was not prepared for how delicious my food was going to be!  The garlic mashed potatoes were beyond perfect.  They were smooth and creamy but with some chunky pieces every now and then.  The garlic flavor was perfectly balanced.  You could definitely taste it, but you weren't tasting it hours later.  The lasagna was exceptional as well.  It was also really big for a really fair price, 7 bucks I think.  The noodles were a perfect al dente, the tomato sauce was fresh and robust, the ricotta was yummy, and the sausage had a great kick to it.  I have nothing bad to say about this place!  Plus, they share space with my new obsession, so how can I go wrong?"

Last time we visited was Monday following NASCAR weekend and waited a good 45 minutes for our food, after waiting 20 minutes to order.

A few people had smoothies, and some different hot tea selections too - there is so much to choose from, it's kind of overwhelming!  A few hours later, Sarah G sold me on an iced green jasmine tea - it was also wonderful!\n\nChristine and Brandy took care of our group and they were sweet - 4 stars for the service.  5 stars for the tea and the huge selection!  3 stars because they were not open when I arrived at 10:30; the doors didn't open until 11!

The happy hour specials are good, and we have tossed a few back here having great talks and enjoying the ambiance.\nNow for the bad: The food is overpriced for it's quality. The steaks look fatty, the salads wilted, and flavor pretty bland. It would probably be okay if we weren't looking at 20 plus dollars per entree. Back in the day, Durant's was very high end and elite, so I could see the pricing from that perspective. However, if they want to stay in the game, they need to keep the food up to par as well. \n5 stars plus for ambiance, relaxation, a throw back feel, and great drinks! 1 star for food and food prices. \nHowever, a major landmark in Phoenix, so please check it out!

Four,This is the best gluten free pizza I have ever had. There is some sort of spice in the dough that makes it taste very unique. I order it at least once a week. I must say that I am a bit embarrassed to call since they identify you by your phone number. I always order the same thing. I gave it a four star since there seems to be an inconsistency on how much the dough is cooked from time to time. \n\nThe play area is fun for the kids too. A few moms and I head over one day a week for lunch. It is a nice day out and they have good price pizza specials!
Five,"The Phoenix metro area is definitely not known for authentic Asian cuisine. China Magic Noodle House, however, is the real deal. This place reminds me of the Taiwanese delis that I used to go to in LA, as well as noodle houses that I've frequented in Taipei.\n\nThey have a great selection of cold noodle, hot noodle and soup noodle dishes. And, a variety of ways to have your noodles (I typically order the thick noodles or shaved noodles). There's always a veggie on the whiteboard to try and the fried tofu is very tender and tasty with the dipping sauce.\n\nIf you're looking for a reasonably priced, ethnically authentic meal in Phoenix (especially the East Valley), China Magic Noodle House should be near the top, if not first, on your list. the only negative that I would have about this place is that there isn't enough choices where chicken is the main protein."
Two,"Okay, so I finally decided it was time to get rid of my old flip phone and upgrade to a smartphone.  I was super excited.  My grandmother and Iare on a family plan together and she lives in Tucson.  She mailed me my phone and was told that I can just go to a Sprint Store up here and have it activated.  I took my phone into this store and the associate, I think his name was John, told me in order to access the account, he needed the pin # or the answer to the security question.  I didn't know either and I used the store's phone to call my grandma (since sprint had turned off my service a couple days before) and my grandma was giving me a lot of answers that were not the right ones.  I was really upset and couldn't believe that this was so difficult.  I asked to speak to someone else and he said that they would tell me the same thing.  At this point, I'm the only customer in the store and two other associates are wandering around and I know they can tell I'm upset.  Neither of them came over and offered to help at all....He told me that my grandmother had to call customer service to reset the password.  Well, that's a whole other story.  Well, at the end of the day when I met up with my husband (after he had a few beers) he took my phone played around on it for literally less than a minute and magically, it was activated.  \n\nI can't believe that this person is in customer service.  He is an idiot and should be fired.  When I was extremely upset, he showed no emotion at all and couldn't help me at all.\n\nThe next day, my husband and I went into this exact same sprint store, to get my contacts transferred over and I just wish that guy had been there.

I asked him why and he said because it was accidental damage and I told him I had insurance and he said it did not matter. He didn't bother to look up my account info, he didn't bother trying to find some sort of solution other than paying 600$ in full for a new phone.

Hell is real.\""""\n\nSince then, I've always associated Home Depot with hell.\n\nThis Home Depot? Not so hellish. We found workers here and there, some even answered hubby's questions adequately enough, but eh...well, you know how it is.\n\nI looked at sinks and bath shower replacements - they all seemed so...I don't know...substandard? Everything was this cheap acrylic junk. I wouldn't want another acrylic sink because we have one now and I hate it. Absolutely hate it - I put scorch marks in it after putting a hot pan in the sink after use...I had done that before in our house in Vegas and we had an awesome stainless steel sink. Our house in California has a heavy duty ceramic sink, so oops...anyway, not used to nor do I like acrylic anything - not even on my nails! ;)\n\nWe have some lighting issues in the house and  the guy who helped us was pretty knowledgeable. He was able to guide us through some of our toughest questions and didn't make us feel like total home improvement noobs, either.\n\nIf I had to choose between here and Lowe's, Lowe's wins - hands down. But this place really is much better than other Home Depots I've been in."""""""
Five,"Joey's is Da Bomb! \n\nI was in Cave Creek earlier this week for a Yoga Class and noticed Joey's of Chicago in the same plaza. Having liked the food at their Happy Valley location we had to give this one a try too!\n\nWe ordered hot dogs with everything, fries and onion rings. Everything was great and satisfied that craving we get once in a while for a good Chicago-style hot dog. \n\nSo if you're from Chicago or like Chicago-style dogs Joey's is the place."
Three,"""Air travel is what it is these days. I've flown A LOT (over 2 million miles on American) and US Airways is not much different than the others. I LOVE American due to the preferntial treatment I get for being such a good customer.\n\nAfter relocating to Phoenix I've had to fly US Airways. Southwest is not an option as I consider it the Greyhound of the skies.\n\nToday I had a great experience on US, great flight attendants, an exit row seat with the row all to myself and on-time arrivals at both of my destinations. \n\nBoth the airlines and the flying public could do more to make air travel more comfortable. We shouldn't bring everything in our closet for a weekend trip, make sure we're familiar with how to pack our liguids, gels and aersols and not carry so many metal objects that it takes an hour to get through security.\n\nFrom the airlines we should expect a seat when we pay for it, our luggage to arrive on the same plane we did and a comfortable seat (I wish for a lot). I won't hold my breath for the comfortable seat. But how about one a 6'2\ person like me can sit in somewhat comfortably.\n\nAll in all you could do worse than US Airways. I hope to update this review someday and give them FIVE stars, but until now only three."""""""
Four,"I'm a local, but this was my first time here. \n\nPRO: Ambiance is a major plus (live music will have that effect on you). Very 'chillaxing. During the day, the view is just beautiful. You can see all of fountain hills below the patio, and the backdrop is what most Arizonans will be proud for--the breathtaking view. The food is pretty good, not overly proportioned but just satisfying in appetite. \n \nCON: the service takes FOREVER. You're lucky if you get your food within 20 mins of ordering. And I mean at every part of my dining experience, this place is slow. The time it took for me to get my food was  long, the time it took to get a refill was extra long, and the time it took for them to bring out the check (let alone getting back your credit card), makes it not even worth it. \n\nin summary, I'd go here if I wanted to casually impress a group of friends for a good value, but be prepared to wait."
Four,"Last visited 4/27/12...\n\nI have been here several times so I am surprised that I have not written a review yet.\n\nEach time I have been here, the food has been very good.  I have tried a range of BBQ dishes including the Baby Backs, Tri-Tip, Brisket and Pulled Pork.  Each meat has been great.  Many sides to choose from.  Baked Beans, sweat potato mashed, regular and garlic mashed, etc.  The Mac and Cheese is probably not their best dish.  Biscuits are good as is the corn bread.  I also enjoy the Fried Green Tomatoes as an appetizer. \n\nService is usually very good and attentive.  This last visit, I was a little disappointed about the ability to keep drinks full. It seems anywhere I have been going lately wait staff has a very hard time paying attention to drinks.  This to me is a huge service error and likely to always cost a restaurant an extra star. \n\nI have also had desserts there although not this last time, Too Full!!  \n\nIt is a great location.  Parking is always available although on weekends you may have to walk from back lot a little as this location shares with Dave and Busters and Cadillac Ranch.\n\nOverall, a very good dinner on Friday night!!"
One,"I'm so disappointed with this Location!\n\nI have been here more than 5 times now,and each and every time the cookies have not been properly baked!\n\nUnderdone and or old! I can tell just by looking at them,I don't know why I continue to waste my money here.\n\nI gave them a chance being that they were new, but their cooks really need to get a clue, none of the other locations I have been to have a problem with their cookies only this one!\n\nI will not go back here for cookies or anything else!"
Five,Took a Cannonade to be repaired at this shop. They fixed it quickly and in a manner that was better than expected and at a great price.\n\nSelection of American-made bikes is nice.\n\nAccessories are expensive and no great deals on anything besides bikes. Some accessories I asked for were not available but it wasn't why I was there.\n\nThe neighborhood is pretty scary and I even saw a crackhead hooker that stank and who was asking about a bike that someone stole from her. Very entertaining.
Five,"So this is my spot, hands down. I spend more time in this particular building than any other building on any given week, except my house (I work from home, so no I'm not a lazy grocery store wandererer).  They have the bomb diggity Starbucks with my Starbucks peoples, they have a good deli, good meat department, great bakery, dope wine selection and just generally kick the crap out of every other grocery store I go to. I have been to some craptacular Safeway's, and they just make me love this one that much more. It's been recently remodeled, so everything's nice and clean. If you need a solid Safeway or grocery store trip in this area, this is the true gem!"
Three,"Sometimes there's a cover, and sometimes there isn't. In true nightclub fashion, you can never really tell what it's going to be either. \n\nI've never seen anything good happen downstairs. The music has never been good, regardless of the genre that night (Hip Hop, Techno, etc). And, the overall vibe is pretty lackluster.\n\nUpstairs, however, is house music heaven. Located outside under the stars, on a relatively small balcony, the vibe is always pretty stellar. Open air, video collages on the walls, and AWESOME music. I've never been let down yet. Even on a random Wednesday evening recently, when it was almost empty, the music was still amazing.\n\nIf you live in the Valley, you have to visit the upstairs of Bar Smith at least once. It's fantastic. It's a shame they've never been able to replicate any of the upstairs magic to the rest of the club though."
Five,"Wow, these guys were great!!!! I had a few minutes to kill waiting for a restaurant to open and remembered driving by many times. Pulled up to the automatic cleaner and the guy started spraying the front of my car, so I rolled up my windows and they continued all the way around, rinsing and scrubbing. When they were done, I paid the guy $7 for a average a little above basic wash and went into the machine. When I got out, 2 guys were there and dried the rest of the car and used an air pressure thing to get the water out of the little crevasses they get into and leave water marks. They did an excellent job and will continue to go there when in the area."
Five,"With Valentine's Day around the corner, now is the time I start warning my husband NOT to buy me chocolates.  Somehow I believe that giving them up is going to miraculously result in a 20 lb weight loss.  One can always hope.\n\nThis year is different.  After sampling these delightful confections at the DBG Chile and Chocolate Festival, I was hooked.  At the time, I sampled an itsy bitsy bite of the passion fruit chocolate, I was sold.  I wished I had a trunk full of disguises readily available so that I could eat each and every morsel on that tray.  It was too early to buy chocolates for the holidays, but we did go to the boutique at the Montelucia a month later.  I'm sure the valet appreciated parking our vehicle with it's sweet scent of our Chompie's leftovers in the back seat. \n\nWe selected several different boxes for ONLY the people I thought would appreciate such exquisite chocolates.  Anyone that I've witnessed shoving an entire chocolate in their mouth with 2 chews at best was off the list.  That left a small list which was great for me considering these pricey little gems.  And despite my faint-hearted protests, my husband smartly insisted on choosing a box for me.  There are actually only a handful of selections, but truthfully, the flavors are so brilliant, you will not need any more.  My favorite is the passion fruit, followed closely by the French caramel truffle.  I usually don't even like caramel, but this toffee covered truffle is filled with the creamiest caramel you can imagine.\n\nThe boutique is open every day, until 10 pm Wed-Sat!  We had the pleasure of meeting Julia on our visit and she let us know they offer chocolate and wine pairings as well!!"
Four,Friendly and professional. I was relieved to find CarLife did the same milage reccomended services Lexus requires and at a much better price. They have a tech there that worked for Lexus at one time so he has been trained on Lexus' specific requirements. The work I needed done was done perfectly and the guys that work there are friendly and accomadating. Driving me to the mall so I could shop while I waited for the car and picking me up when it was done. The shop had a small town feel which I liked. Definitely a place I will continue to take my car to.
One,"The customer service at the Avondale location is terrible!\nLets start with the Vet. We brought our puppies in for their shots and the vet was so rude! She question why we got two puppies, where we got them and why didn't they have their shots? Then she preceded to lecture us on what a big responsibility it is to take care of one dog let alone two and that she doesn't know how we are going to potty train two dogs. My husband and I are not stupid, we have grown up with dogs which our parents still have to this day, we know what it takes to take care of a dog. \n\nNow lets talk about the receptionist. We had to listen to her life story while taking forever to get our payment and give us the next appt.\nWe got a call when getting ready to head out for the next appt. telling us that they scheduled wrong and that they couldn't see us at our appt and to reschedule. This happened to us three times. After the third time we decided it was time to find a new vet."
Four,"Love their pizza. They only serve thin crust but it's a nice soft dough with a crunchy crust. I've never sat in the dining room because they have a nice hi-top seating area in the bar. Less of a wait if you grab one of those and I actually like the atmosphere in the bar area better. It's a great place to stop for a bite before or after the free Art Walk on Thursday nights in Old Town. \n\nLast time we were there they mentioned that they stoke their ovens (sounds kinky) from 4-5 pm daily, so nothing goes in the oven during that time. \n\nThey have specials on their wines on Tuesdays. I think they were half off."
Four,"I seriously can't wait to take my parents here!!!  After the OYE, I called Mom to tell her about the slide.  The one that I didn't really make it down very well because my legs were sticky from the walk up the driveway.  Well, I got a ride, but it was still hot out.  I know.  Gross.  Whatever.\nThe service here is suuuuuuuper friendly!  Everyone was really nice and seemed to be enjoying their jobs.\nThe food I would say was OK.  Great variety, though not overly original.  Options for vegetarians, too.\nI'll definitely be back a LOT.  My stepdad is gonna love this place!!"
Four,"One thing I am wicked excited about now that I am home is all the Fro Yo around here. I love this stuff and the east coast does not have many options for frozen treats, since well, its only hot for about 3 months, maybe, and its not as trendy as it is out here, naturally. \n\nSo I stumbled upon Mojo last night.. fn fyeah! I like trying a little of everything so I mixed the Tart Pomegranate, Skinny Strawberry and White Boy Vanilla flavors, topped them off with rainbow jimmy's, gummy bears, fresh strawberries and bits of cheesecake, weird, but f-ing awesome. I was a little bummed that they were out of blueberries and a few other fresh fruit options, but I got there 20 minutes before closing so I can't expect it to be fully stocked at the time.\n\nI really dug the whole peace love & happiness vibe going on and it's pretty much perfect for anyone with their non-dairy and low fat options as well. Mojo is awesome, and certainly beats out any JP Licks or Berryline in Bean Town.. totally going back."
Three,"Siu Wok is probably my favorite Chinese fast food joint in Phoenix. They were one of the only places that I knew of in the downtown area that delivered and their food isn't as reliant on being breaded and deep-fried as other cheap Chinese food joints. While I wouldn't go so far as to say this is one of the best Chinese places in the area, I do appreciate them being around. The people who work here are super friendly and they've got a killer lunch special. However, the food is a little on the greasy side-- strictly a comfort food, local version of Panda Express, but slightly better. My only major gripe-- they're not open on Sundays!"
Three,"So I had to get some blood drawn and I wasn't allowed to eat breakfast, which to me is a perfect excuse to treat myself to fancy coffee drinks and breakfast on my way to work. Oy, it was a bad karma day, though:\n\nDrip Coffee: Closed on Mondays (WTF??)\nTwo Hippies Tacos: Despite the flashing red OPEN sign, CLOSED until 10:30.  (WTFFF????)\n\nSo, got my coffee at Lola's (good as always, but why is their small so, well, small?) and drove around aimlessly for foodage. Happened upon a cute little idea, a cafe inside a bike shop! How fun!\n\nThe sandwich was excellent, which is why I'm even writing this review: the bread tasted homemade, the eggs were creamy, and the ham was piked high and thick-cut. Mmmm."
One,"""I've tried Jimmy John's twice now, and both times I've been disappointed. Although I have a masochistic streak now and then, I'm not going to give it a third try--too much pain for me! \nVisit one:  good sandwich, lots of food for the price, relatively quick, but no ice and soda was warm. In the summer in Phoenix, cold soda is kind of a basic need. And they didn't say anything about this until I had already bought a soda. I would have wanted to know in advance that I was about to drink lukewarm soda on a 110 degree day. But things happen and I needed a quick lunch to bring back to the office, so I thought I would try them again today. Bad idea. \nVisit two:  stood in line to order for 10 minutes. No movement at all. I counted 11 people working behind the counter, but no one taking orders for some reason. I should have left, but I decided to double-down and wait a bit more. When they finally took my order, the woman behind the counter muttered something about their meat slicer being broken since yesterday, so they were running out of things. Really? Um, get a new slicer if your business depends on it, like this one does. I ordered a sandwich right off the menu, then proceeded to wait another 10 minutes for my sandwich. Actually, I got mad when other people who just walked in were getting their sandwiches, and I had to \reorder\"""" by yelling my sandwich order to the people making the sandwiches. No apology ever for the 20 minute wait. I wasn't the only customer wondering what was going on today--I suspect that Jimmy John's lost a fair share of goodwill with a lot of people. \nThere are now plenty of good places to eat in downtown Phoenix, and I will now frequent them instead. It's too bad that Jimmy John's can't get its act together, because the sandwiches are decent. \nMy lunch equation:  Decent sandwiches + crappy service = I'm not returning"""""""
Two,"""Everyone at Buca is very friendly.  Their lunch is nice sized portions (unlike their dinner portions which are only suitable for \family style\"""" sharing).  My g/f and I ordered their Apple Gorgonzola Salad and their Vegetarian Pizza.  Both were \""""just ok\"""".  The salad had too many competing flavors including overly cinnamon seasoned walnuts competing with the other fresh flavors.  Also, their Italian vinaigrette didn't quite seem to match the other ingredients.  The pizza had a limp crust.  The toppings were nice with broccoli, peppers and mushroom flavors standing out.  Overall, the experience was 'ok' but I won't be rushing to go back."""""""
Three,"After reading the reviews, I decided I had to check this place out. The hostess  had me sign a waiver as I entered providing my phone number and email address. This is to release Spanish Fly of any liability with the pool use. I gave the nice girl a fake number and email address.\n\nOkay- so now that I've made it past the front door, I seated myself at the bar next to a good looking gentleman visiting from New Jersey. How much does it cost to use the daybeds and cabanas on a weekend? I hope you are sitting down....$300 for one bottle with a two bottle minimum. Do the math. WTF? Why is a potentially good thing always ruined by $$$? I was told they make $40K on one Saturday. I guess so! They can have it for that price.\n\nThe pool area is very small. I don't mean the pool itself. I mean the tiny 12 inch circumference space around the pool provided for people NOT renting the ridiculously expensive cabanas. Or you are welcome to sit at one of the five small, cramped together tables. \n\nThe music playing at the indoor bar during the day is lively, beachy and upbeat. That's a good thing.The draft beer was reasonably priced, another good thing. The pool closes at 7 PM.\n\nI had high hopes for this place. A pool inside a bar concept is way cool. But, the small deck area is a turn off. I should prob. come back at night to see what the crowd is like, but I'm really in no hurry to experience that."
Five,"""As I sit on my \perch\"""" on the second floor of this library, I write this review.   I absolutely LOVE coming here and I give this library my 3rd 5-star rating.  Here is why....\n\n(Keep in mind, I'm writing this review as a working professional and not as a student of the college).\n\nWhen you walk into this library, you are awe-struck by the beautiful architectural design of the building.  During the day, this library is full of bright natural light because it is surrounded by glass windows from top to bottom.  The library is a huge open air space so that the light flows from the 2nd floor down to the first floor.  \n\nI come to this library to read my own books or use their computers to do some studying.  I love to take one of the computers that faces the Southeast of the building.  There are near panoramic views of South Mountain.  The views are stunning as, I believe, this is the tallest building south of downtown.\n\nThe library provides free (for now) wi-fi.  Private study room are reservable for the public use.  State of the art media rooms that must be reserved.  There are a few things I want to keep secret.  I don't want everyone in the VAlley to know because I don't want to see this library turn into the circus at some libraries.  YOu'll have to find out for yourself.\n\nThe library is conveniently located on the South Mountain Community College Campus if you attend school or live in the area, that's a bonus.  \n\nI personally never imagined myself being that person that comes to the library weekly to read a book .  I could do this at the Starbucks up the street that I am the Duchess of.  BUT, I LOVE this place and I spend less money!  ;-)  But to be honest I do.  I'm a bonafide people watcher too, and I have found that there are other regulars to the library just like e and they all have their own interesting stories.  Some of them I've talked to and inquired about why they frequent the SML and others, I just observe quietly."""""""
Four,"Some of the best cheesesteaks i've had. Should of went with the more popular original (steak & cheese whiz), but instead, tried it with my fav, provolone. While the meat and chesse tasted really good, the overall finish was somewhat dry. Probably my only drawback since all my cheesesteak consisted of was bread + steak + provolone cheese. I'm going back because the fries were some of the best I've had. The service was very friendly. My fiance ordered the kids meal (she wanted the grilled cheese) and said it was really good. Portions are right on, a little too much actually. I got the regular and couldnt finish it. But when I go back, I'm going to try the Steak 'wit cheez'. \n\nA- vote.\n\n01/11/2010 UPDATE: I've been back and tried the original (steak with cheese whiz). Oh my! Now THIS is what I'm talking about!!! Best cheesesteak I've ever had outside of Philly.\n\nA+\n\nAlso- the employees are still as nice as the 1st time. GREAT service, arguably in the top 3 in all of the Phoenix metro. I've been there 6 times to date and haven't been disappointed.\n\nAlso- I must add that their 'fry sauce', whatever mysterious blend of tastebud utopia, is amazing. I don't know what it is, but I love that stuff. Far better than regular ketchup. Also- their fries are ALWAYS cooked to perfection. I've yet to have soggy fries nor old, stale fries. \n\nLOVE THIS PLACE.\n\n(request to owners- if you can, please open up a new location. maybe Tempe Marketplace?? you guys are leaps and bounds better than the Great Steak Escape or whatever they are called)."
Four,"I've been coming to this place for over a year, and thought I'd write a review before I peaced out of this state.\n\nCompared to Bally's, this place is a palace.  Compare this location to the others in the surrounding Scottsdale/Tempe area and this place steps up their game.\n\nThe machines are always clean and you can usually find an empty cardio machine within 5 minutes during peak hours if you are flexible with your machine choice.  It's always good to mix it up.  The strength training machines are nice and I enjoy the variety compared to the other LA Fitness locations.\n\nMy only complaint is the personal trainers that hound you to join a program so they can hit on you.  Not flattering to tell a girl she needs to get in better shape, especially at the cost of $500 a month."
Two,"Where do I begin? If the food is from Chris Bianco you know it's going to be good,  but was tad dissapointed at our antipasto plate. It was rather ordinary and sparse compared to any of the dozen or so times I've had it at Bianco downtown. We also ordered the Rosa which is one of their signature pizza pies with cheese, onion and Arizona pistachios. Delicious. We also thought wine would be a nice choice. Unfortunately, they don't have their liquor license sorted out yet. So a hit and a two misses. \n\nBut here's the main reason they only got two stars: \n\nWe ordered the antipasto plate and when we asked the blonde female waitstaff person who brought it for bread she said they didn't have any. OK, uh, what? Seems that Pane Bianco (White Bread in Italian) doesn't make bread on Saturday's. I said, well, since they make pizza, perhaps you can throw some dough into the oven and bake some. She said they couldn't do that. What? In the meantime our resourceful waiter overheard the conversation and brought us some...wait for it...BREAD. She just looked vacantly at the newly arrived substance and walked away. Word to Mr. Bianco: Please fire her."
Four,"We were immediately greeted by Alberto when we walked in. The decor was casual and a bit quirky. My sister and I shared the seafood pizza and my fiance had the chicken parmesan.  I must say that my sister and I are both picky eaters and we both loved the pizza! Full of flavor and yet not so heavy. My fiance said the chicken parmesan was pounded thin and tasted really good. We ended with the tiramisu, which was full of rum! I wasn't a huge fan of the strong alcohol flavor, but that's just me. I would definitely go back"
Five,"Had been trying to try this place since it was highly reviewed in the Az. Republic several months ago.  I thought it would be best to go in the fall/winter when it would be cooler and more in keeping with fondue and raclette.  Finally did it today which was certainly not cool.  Boy! Am I glad we did.  Went there with my wife and myself as well as my son and his girlfriend.  We found the food choices to be quite extensive.  We ordered French Fondue and Swiss Raclette.  \nThe fondue came first and the four of us enjoyed it very much.  Whether by accident or not, just as we had finished the fondue, the raclette came out.  This was much better than getting both dishes served at the same time.  Don't know if that's the way the restaurant planned it but if not, they should give some thought to doing it that way so the fondue can be enjoyed and then the raclette instead of serving both at the same time and the two dishes( and tastes) competeing with each other.  Both dishes were superb.\nAfterward we had crepes.....o ne was chocolate and banana.  The other was ultimate chocolate.  Both crepes were enough for two and were thoroughly enjoyable.\nWould thoroughly recommend Le Chalet at any time of year.  Only regret is that I waited so long."
Five,"I go to LGO Grocery EVERY time I go to PHX.  It has a very special place in my heart.  The breakfast food is spot-on, every time.  The French Pancakes, which I never get but always get a few bites, are quite possibly the best thing I've ever eaten for breakfast.  With the fresh cream and honey, they're near perfection.  I always get the eggs and bacon, because they prepare them so well, I'm never disappointed and I pair that with a fresh-made english muffin, that will absolutely make you question your assumptions about carbs - because you'll never be able to pass one up, once you try it.  The place isn't inexpensive, but you do get a lot of food for your $$$, so it's worth it.  I have been literally dozens of times over the last year + and it has been great every time.  I love this place.\n\nThe service is always friendly, it's a GREAT hang-out, especially after a nice quick hike up Camelback.  The bathrooms are clean, and very spacious, the parking is sometimes a pain, but it's worth paying for valet if you have to.\n\nWhatever it take, just go."
Four,"Went to the VIP Grand Opening last night for the new Smashburger.  This one is awesome.  Not only is the location close to CenPho but it fills in a space that is in need of decent food.  \n\nThe new Smashburger is on the side of the Best Buy next to the Cold Stone.  They have some outdoor seating and big windows so that you can see in and see what is going on.  \n\nThe place is nicely laid out and there are a decent number of tables (more than the Tempe location).  The staff is friendly and helpful.\n\nAs far as the food goes - well, it is Smashburger.  You can expect to get yourself a salty burger, some slightly greasy fries, and a yummy HaagenDaz shake.  If those are up your alley, then you will love this place.  In my opinion, they make the best fast food burger around.\n\nIf you haven't gotten out to the Tempe location or the new Avondale one yet, go hit this one up.  Im sure it will be packed come lunch time."
Two,"This bar is in my hood and I really wanted to like it, but I just wasn't a big fan. I went on an evening when they had a comedian, but there weren't too many patrons at all. \n\nWe went a bit early to get appetizers and drinks and I honestly could have passed. We ordered an appetizer platter of sorts with wings, mozzarella sticks and mushrooms I think and I didn't care for the way it was cooked at all, very dry. I wasn't expecting five star dining, but even for a sports bar the food wasn't quite up to par. The service was off too. The gal was really nice but didn't seem to have a clue. Every drink we asked about or menu item, she had to keep asking someone else. Maybe she was just new but it seemed more like she really just didn't know what she was doing. \n\nThe patio area for smoking is a bit weird. It is in front of the bar and none of the chairs or outside furniture matched, it just looked kind of like someones back yard. Very odd. \n\nIn all honesty I wouldn't have stayed if I didn't go to see the comedian, who at least made the trip worth it. I do have to give props that they chose a good entertainer and I have heard the bands that play there are pretty good as well. Maybe I'll return for a live band performance and have a better experience."
Four,"This is a lovely hotel with a very friendly and accommodating staff. I stayed at the Zona this past weekend for a wedding and was very pleased with the accommodations and amenities. There are a few pools, hot tubs, a great restaurant, bar, and fitness center. I'm sure there are other amenities of which I didn't take advantage. \n\nAlso, for as large of a property they are, the room service is great! They are prompt and accurate with deliveries. We really hope to return to Scottsdale for a leisure visit and stay at Zona Hotel and Suites again.  It was truly delightful. \n\nAnd, the free WiFi was nice."
Three,"We were in the mood for fish and chips today, so we headed over to Chandler to try out Churchill's. \n\nIt was Sunday so they had football blaring from the televisions. I understand that is expected, but I don't like the sports bar vibe. I like football, I just don't get into watching the game in a bar. I prefer to listen to music and talk. But I won't knock off too many points for that until I have a chance to go back again on another day and at a different time. Like I said, it was Sunday afternoon and you expect that. \n\nThey have a lot of good beer on tap--Tetley's, Boddington and a whole lot more. That was a big plus. A big minus was the $5.50 price on an imperial pint. There was no bartender on duty that I could see. That did not bother me today since I was there with my family, but if I was wanting to sit at the bar it would have been a little annoying. \n\nIn fact, there was only one woman running the entire place. She was doing a good job of it, not super friendly, but not unfriendly, and she seemed to get nicer the longer we were there. Overall, I really can't complain about the service. She had her work cut out for her, that's for sure. \n\nThe food was mostly good.  Here is what we ordered for the four of us: two orders of fish and chips, a kid's size bangers and mash, a cheeseburger for our niece, and an appetizer of Scotch eggs. I had a Tetley's, and everyone else had soda. Nothing was bad, and the chips (fries) were outstanding. In fact, my wife thought they were the best she had ever tasted.  I thought they were really good also, but not the very best I have ever had. The fish was good, but not great. The bangers and mash were excellent. Our tab ended up being over $60.00, which I thought was a little high for what we ordered. \n\nI'd like to try this place again in the evening when I have a designated driver. If I get a chance to do so I'll amend my review. In the meantime, I'd like to give it 3 and a half stars, but I'll have to settle for 3."
Three,"""2.5 stars, but rounding up.  I was invited to Kabuki in the form of a $50 food blogger gift card, so basically this meal was compliments of the corporate office.  Well, thanks, guys.  I can assume that this marketing venture was to get some honest feedback, and as I always do, I'm going to give it.  The executive summary is, well, I was underwhelmed.  Let me explain.\n\nFirst off, I ordered the shishito pepper app (sauteed Japanese shishito pepper with garlic sauce, $6.95).  It was garnished with what appeared to be shaved bonito, which had little flavor.  The peppers themselves were hit or miss, some being spicy, some not, but overall, it was kind of bland.  How can a pepper appetizer be bland?  I have no idea, honestly.  \n\nNext up was the octopus salad (octopus, cucumber and daikon on top of gourmet spring mix served with ponzu sauce and sesame oil, $8.95).  The octopus was served cold and nicely cooked, not really chewy which was nice.  \Gourmet spring mix\"""" is a bit of a stretch - if you've bought baby spring mix from a grocery store (ya know, the bags), you're familiar with it.  The problem with the salad is that it was sitting in a pool of dressing.  It would be a nice light salad in the summer, but not really that memorable or substantial enough for a main course. \n\nTime for sushi - that's why I'm here, right?  Ordered the fresh water eel ($4.95), yellowtail ($3.95) and fatty tuna ($9.95) nigiri.  As you might imagine, if you've had toro, that it was the highlight - smooth, luscious, melt-in-your-mouth; just what I wanted.  The yellowtail was served almost room temp and I sent it back - gross (they took it off the bill).  The eel was fine - no real complaints, but nothing special.  I also ordered the Lotus on Fire roll (spicy tuna, lotus root and jalapeno on top of a california roll, $9.95).  As the first roll on the \""""specialty rolls\"""" list, I expected it to be a knock-out, but it wasn't.  First off, the spicy tuna didn't make much of an impact, and didn't have that nice kick I like in good versions, even with the presence of the jalapeno.  Another thing that confused me was....since it's called Lotus on Fire, shouldn't I see a whole piece of lotus root on top?  Instead, it was maybe a 1/4 of a slice, and the piece had clearly been fried hours ago and was kind of soggy and flavorless.  I know I'm picking nits here, but the whole presentation confused me - there was a pile of spicy tempura breadcrumbs along side which I really liked with the roll, so why not just top the roll with them?  It was a nice textural contrast.  The two sauces on the side I barely noticed until the end - one was a spicy mayo, and the other, well, I'm not quite sure.  Needless to say, neither really did it for me.  \n\nService was friendly, competent, and I hope others have the same experience.  I had no complaints in that department. \n\nI must make a final remark - the menu.  Imagine if you're favorite sushi joint had a one night stand with Cheesecake Factory, Kabuki might be their love-child.  I don't know if the idea is to give people so many options they can't decide and need two drinks to make up their mind, but it's overwhelming, and I even looked at the menu before walking in.  Can a place really be good at everything?  If you hacked that menu in a third, you might have a standard-size menu.  It was a bit much.\n\nI truly did appreciate the invite to Kabuki, but dining on my own dime, I'm really not sure if I'm willing to work my way through that novel-of-a-menu to pick out the gems.  As with all these things, your mileage may vary.  Cheers."""""""
Five,"I wish I had time to be super creative, crafty and productive. Going into Made Art only makes that yearning stronger!\n\nIt's the perfect plact to find a variety of gifts for people of many interests. I was able to knock out my Christmas shopping for my 3 sisters, best friend, roommate, and a little something for myself in about an hour after about 50 circles around the store. (There is so much to see you have to do a few laps.)\n\nThey have really cute, funky baby clothes, but I personally find it difficult to spend too much money on something that will be dirty and smelly within a few minutes and then too small. They also have a really eclectic selection of books that are fun to leaf through, and even have some craft books in case you get inspired while you browse!\n\nI don't know the name of the girl who assisted me but she was super helpful (and had great hair.) She went through my shopping list with me and would point out things I may have missed or paired a couple things here and there to make a fun set. You have to know a lot of what they have is hand made, and it's an independent boutique so prices will tend to be higher but  I don't find most of the stuff overly pricy at all for the unique quality you get."
Four,"Tried this place after getting a groupon.  I was very pleasantly surprised.  The location is not the best, but what was lacking in appearance, certainly made up for it with the food that was served.\n\nThe decor inside of the restaurant is very well put together.  Somewhat, a kind of modern mexican feel.  \n\nI ordered the Cola and Pineapple Soy Braised Angus Short Rib Roast.  A great choice that I will definitely order again.  The meat was so tender and melted in your mouth.  The spices were spot on.  I paired it with the green chili cornbread casserole and chipotle cheddar mashed potatoes.  Both of which were amazing.\n\nMy fiance had the pernil asado.  This was also very good, but was not my favorite of the two.  Although, I don't really eat pork.\n\nOverall, I would definitely recommend.  If you plan on going, get reservations, or you might end up having to sit at the bar.  Its a small place.  Sometimes so busy that they never answer their phone (something they can probably improve on)."
Three,"""I really wasn't expecting this place to be spectacular because 90% of the \Mexican\"""" restaurants in this town serve the same stuff the same way for the same price.  This place was no exception.  You get a decent plate of food complete with rice and re-fried beans for under $10.  The same ole' tacos, burritos, etc. you would find at just about any other place.  Nothing special to be found here.\n\nI did enjoy the serve yourself chip and salsa bar.  The chips were good and the salsas were good as well.  I also liked that the staff was very friendly and the food was ready in under 5 minutes.  They have it all down pretty good for the 12:00 \""""lunch rush\"""" of which I was a part.  My coworkers and I were out of there in under an hour.\n\nI ordered the chile rellenos.  For some reason they felt the need to put some type of thick breading over the chillies.  This is no bueno.  However, after picking off the breading the chillies were quite good.  Spicy and full of cheese just the way I like them.  The re-fried beans and rice that came with the meal were just ok."""""""
Five,"""First off, let me tell you that I have been eating Persian food for 30 years, all over the country, as it is one of my favorite types of cuisine...... And this is BAR NONE the best I've ever had.\n\nTypically when I call to ask a Persian eatery if they have tah-dig available at opening time (11:00-11:30 am) they cannot accomodate my request ...as it is \the crispy bottom of the rice pot\"""" and they need to serve the pot of rice before getting to the delicious bottom. I have even had one manager laugh at me when I asked for it!!! At Pars, they ALWAYS have it available for me! Maybe i've just been lucky as gfar as timing goes...but if they have it available, GET IT..with BOTH stews. Fantastic! \n\nI have not seen Olivieh salad(app) at ANY Persian restaurant in AZ!. And they make it beautifully here! \n\nThe Kashk-o-bademjan is wonderful, too! As is the Maust O khair(apps)\n\nWe usually get the Sultani dish(combo of succulent tender filet mignon along with koobideh), and the chicken Shish dish..giant beautiful pieces of chicken breast..seasoned to perfection!\nThe meals are accompanied by a grilled tomato..yum! And vidalia onions(so sweet, my husband eats them like potato chips!) & the homemade pita bread....heavenly. \n \nEverything on the menu is fantastic..but we tend to gravitate towards the aforementioned menu items. Even when we get it for take out, they take extra special care packaging it up for you, so it doesn't spill on the way home....AND they always include a little bit of sumac..without even having to ask!   There is so much food, it usually lasts us ALL MEALS for 2 days. \nIt's very reasonably priced & the staff is so kind, warm & wonderful. They really treat us as if they value our business. It's a really GOOD feeling. \n\nI'll wrap it up by saying this.....we drive an hour and a half (1-1/2 hrs) round trip for this food & it is worth every second of driving time & worth every penny we spend on fuel.\nYou won't be disappointed!!!"""""""
Five,"Continue to come here for breakfast, been 8 or 9 times now and it still has yet to fail me. Today I had the santa fe sautee and it was delicioso!! There are so many options on the menu that it is hard to choose from, but I have definitely found 3 favorites on here. The turkey and avocado sandwich was not a fav.. but I'm not much of an avocado fan anyway. I definitely recommend this place to people looking for a good breakfast joint."
Four,"This is a quaint little coffee shop run by Hospice Care Colorado, and provides some basics for a small store.  They have plenty of seating and the shop is always staffed by friendly volunteers.  The coffee is all fair trade and readily available, or they can whip up espresso drinks as well.  They have plenty of local pastries, scones, muffins, and the donuts are delish.  in addition, all proceeds go towards a hospice center.  \nWe stop into Cups Coffee House each time we are in Grand Junction."
Five,"I'm giving this five fat stars because I'd get fat if I still lived in Arizona and was subjected to the close proximity of this restaurant to my apartment.  And job.  \n\nI can't remember other things on the menu, other than the Pad Thai.  I'm not sure if Pad Thai is Thai (makes sense that it would be), but I see it at non-fusion Chinese restaurants, often.  Anyway, I don't care about authenticity when something is this spectacularly good.\n\nI am very afraid of flying.\n\nI had to fly back and forth from Phoenix to Burbank (Los Angeles area) once per month for work.\n\nI needed comfort when I stepped off the plane, regardless of if it had only been a one hour and five minute flight.\n\nI'd make a beeline here after getting back to Arizona.\n\nYummy Pad Thai.  I miss you so much.\n\nYou were my friend and comfort against the horrors and fears of the scorpion enemies.  \n\nWide, flat (but short) noodles.. slightly curled..  chicken, egg, sprouts, and other good-tasting things.  \n\nI would usually get my order to-go, but the seating area seems cool, too.  Service was also great..  to-go order always ready to go..  price was right.\n\nYou know that feeling you get in the deepest parts of your gums and jaw..  that tingling thing that begins the process of salivation?  It's happening now.  They're heeeeeere!"
Two,"Glad I'm not the only one who could care less about coming back to Myst.  Very typical club, with pretty hideous music on a Friday night (the hip hop in the smaller room was ok once he started playing some fun classics that I could actually dance to).  Whatever noise was playing in the main room was ridiculous... everyone there was probably just so out of it that they didn't notice that the dj was just spinning s*** on vinyl.  \n\nNo intentions of returning, but it was fun dancing for a bit to some oldie hip hop."
Three,"We called ahead so we didn't have to wait, we didn't get the constant asking about our food or anything like that.  In fact we didn't see our server very often at all. \n\nWe waited a long time for food, drinks, and refills. I asked about 5-6 times for some bread before he brought any. \n\nFood was only okay.  I ordered pulled pork dinner and it was tasty, but kinda dry, wife and son said same thing about the ribs, very dry, my wife had to ask for more BBQ sauce.\n\nOldest son had cheeseburger, and he seemed satisfied, but youngest son ad sliders and took one bite and wouldn't eat them saying they were nasty. He's 4, so take that as you will.\n\n\nIt was my middle sons birthday, we let the server know and they brought out a saddle and Sunday and announced it was his birthday and for everyone to give a bid loud yeee haaw. \n\nOverall it wasn't a horrible experience, our server seemed nice, but very busy.  \n\nIt won't be my first choice of place to eat again, but I may consider eating there again some day."
Four,"We came here for lunch and it was sad to see the place only had 1 table.  When we walked in there was no sign or any information telling you to order at the counter.  I finally saw the employee in the cooking area say hello and told me the menus are at the counter.  Just walk up and order when you are ready.  \n\nI ordered the ALFREDO PIZZA adding chicken (Alfredo sauce w/mozzarella cheese).  The crust was thin and crispy, the sauce was lacking a little, the mozzarella cheese and chicken was excellent.  I tired a slice of the SAL'S WHITE PIZZA and it was great.  \n\nWhy no 5 stars?  No wait service."
Four,"I love the Phoenix zoo. So I grew up in south Phoenix and this was our go to field trip in elementary school. \n\nSeriously, we went every year. \n\nBut I was ok with that because I loved it. I've enjoyed picnics (the way too go, the food is not that great and it's expensive), birthday parties, and scavenger hunts here. I even saw a wedding here once. On a nice day it makes for a great walk. Too bad they didn't have the water park type area when I was a kid. It looks so refreshing to splash in during the summer when the afternoons can be unbearable. Trust me, I've thought about shoving a kid or too out of the way just to enjoy a sprinkle.  \n\nIt's also nice to come here in December when it's a little chilly and grab a cup of hot chocolate and enjoy Zoo Lights."
Five,"I feel very fortunate that I live across the street from this Ahwatukee pizza bistro.  They make wonderful pies, I take out from here once a week.  The waitrons are attentive and the pizza is ready in 20 minutes.\n\nI recommend the Hawaiian (ham, pepperoni, and pineapple),  the Flaumbay (pepperoni, green bell peppers, garlic, and pineapple), or the RASPOTLE (chicken, roasted red bell peppers, raspberry chipotle sauce, and a choice of feta or goat cheese/no mozzarella cheese).  The crust is thin, but sweet and chewy.  They make a wonderful tomato sauce, that adds to the taste of the fresh veggies and meat."
One,"""First off let me say I thought it was going to be great after reading all these positive reviews.  Not so much.. We went last night. It was so crowded but we were able to get a table.  We started off with the poke.  When it came it looked interesting but it was aweful.  The fish tasted water logged from being frozen and then defrosted. The flavor overall  was really bland.  The fish wasnt even fresh.  Come on now.  It you are going to serve raw fish lets make it fresh please.  The wonton chips tasted like they came out of the bag and even tasted a bit stale.  \nI had the vegetable plate.  On the menu they said these were local farm fresh vegetables.  Terrible.  The tomato was hard as a rock and the basil on top was all shriviled like it had been old.  The swiss chard and the asparagus were ok, but nothing special. Very oily... The corn tasted like it was frozen corn with cheese in it.  yuck.  The craziset thing was that there was a huge huge pile of coldslaw that dominated the plate.  What is that even doing on there?\nMy husband had the shrimp poboy and again it was ok but the shrimp tasted frozen and just fried.  My son had the corn dog and loved it.  At least someone liked their meal.  This place really needs to rethink its \farm to table\"""" concept because they are really not living up to that statement."""""""
Four,"So, firstly when you enter this place for happy hour, its difficult to believe you are in Phoenix. It seems more like LA . Its crowded, people are hip, there is energy in the place and the food is great. \nWent with a friend for happy hour. So , now while I was not too happy with my cocktail (Mango mai tai) , I loved the food. We ordered the caterpillar roll, the salmon roll and shrimp tempura. The crab puffs werent too great but the stuffed shrimp was awesome and very filling. \nThe service was excellent even though it was really crowded and the ambience is lovely, the music was great. However, its not difficult to have a conversation with your friends as its not so noisy. . Would definitely recommend. \nThey dont take reservations for happy hour, so get there early if you are in a big group."
Five,"I love the location!  It is clean and the employees here are super helpful and friendly.  I've shopped here many times since I moved to Chandler and I have never been disappointed.  In terms of variety and products they have most of the same things that Whole Foods has with the exception of things like a salad bar and deli counter or wine tasting within the store.  I don't NEED those things.  I love being about to go and purchase antibiotic free, hormone free chicken and grass fed beef.  And honestly I don't see a huge price difference between say Sprouts and Fry's and I know what I'm getting at Sprouts.  Their produce section is very nice and everything looks great.  They have a couple of rows of bulk products as well.  \n\nSprouts started in Arizona in 2002.  They are a local company and as near as I can tell they have not sold out to anyone.  I love shopping at local places and putting my money back into the local economy.  They also have a cute website.  Check it out :\n\nhttp://sprouts.com/home.php\n\nThis particular store is not a HUGE place.  I like that.  It does not take long to find the things you need.  It's great if you're in a hurry.  Just run in, grab what you need and you're on your way!\n\nThank you Sprouts!"
Four,"Lunch specials 7 days a week. Prices are very reasonable considering the quality of the food. \n\nMy wife has special dietary needs, and a request for a dish with no onion, garlic, or pepper (hot)... Unfortunately the standard white sauce has white pepper, and the waitress forgot this. As we started to eat, Pammy discovered the pepper, the attentive waitress knew something was wrong and wanted to make it right. The other waiter got involved and they both insisted that she get a fresh meal without pepper, so special sauce was made fresh and her new meal arrived in minutes.\n\nSince the first meal with pepper could easily be put in a box, for me to eat later (I have no restrictions), and since the second meal came with all the sides (rice, eggroll, and crab puff) we wanted to pay for all three meals. But the staff would not let us, insisting it was 'on the house'. \n\nOf course we will be back many times. Friendly staff, nice atmosphere, great tasting food with quality ingredients."
One,"OK. So I think that this may be the first business that gets one star from me.  I just flew home from Israel on this airlines.  Boy, they are pretty sad.  I usually don't like to be too harsh on anyone, but this airlines deserves it.  \n\nPlease, don't think of this review as complaining, but rather a warning to others out there to never fly US airways (Nobody likes a complainer right? Haha.).  Well, not never, but if you have no other choice.  I would venture to guess that this airlines is pretty cheap because of the full flight loads that i encountered.  You could say that is good for them but the service on the planes was not up to par.  I guess I have been spoiled with the likes of Hawaiian Airlines, Nippon airlines, shoot, you can even throw Delta in there.  The flight attendants are rude. This is from both personal experience and from observation of my own.  \n\nYou know what, I could go on and on, but I really don't like to cry about stuff.  Would I fly US Airways again? No way.  If it was one of the last airlines on Earth?  Maybe.  I just hope that their service of customers get better.\n\n  Then again, maybe they didnt treat me well for the fact that I hadn't shaved and looked Talibanish.  Oops."
One,"Hopefully, the organizers get their act together and limit the crowd before the competitors run out of food.\nWe got there around 2:00, got in line and waited about 20 minutes when a staffer comes out with a bullhorn telling everyone that they're not selling anymore tickets until 4 pm because they ran out of food.  \nUnfortunately, the organizers didn't anticipate such a turnout.  I was so looking forward to this event since I was in town for spring training.  Anyway, hopefully next year will be better."
Four,"Set in a very unassuming building is this treasure of a restaurant. The first time I visited about 8 months ago I got a bit tipsy on the sangria, so go easy with that stuff. The problem was that it made me forget what I had eaten.\n\nThis time I was much better about the sangria consumption, just one glass. We did three dishes between the two of us, the Tortilla, the Spinach with Garbonzo beans, and the special that night of Eggplant layers.\n\nThe Tortilla is like a Quiche of Egg with Potato and is okay. The Eggplant was very good, but the winner of all was the Spinach and Garbonzo beans.\n\nI have just recently in the last 4 months gone vegetarian/vegan and am saddened at times by the removal of Pork from my diet. When I started in on this dish I was concerned that I was violating my culinary discipline because the taste of Pork fat was very prevalent. Upon talking with one of the wait staff I learned that the magic ingredient was Smoked Paprika. Absolutely delicious!\n\nThere were some people complaining about the noise which is hilarious to me. Guess what its a Tapas bar, its supposed to be noisy and boisterous. Go to Lola's if you are ready for some conversation and good food!"
Four,"A delightful treat, a scrumptious country meal, reminiscent of a park picnic. These are just a few ways I would explain a meal at Coup Des Tartes. The starters of onion tart and pate were delicious, rustic and great to share. We ordered from the summer price fix meal and found it to a great value - filet and pomme frites with a great green salad for $25..It is BYOB which I loved but my espousa was put off by the $9 corkage fee, I thought is was the best deal going bt he thought it was   pricey...either way it is BYOB so bring something you love. The place is small so you will find it cozy and your fellow dinners will be close by...Enjoy, it is a great casual dining experience."
Three,"I get here often as they are right across the street from a very good car wash in the area.  Their prices are above average compared to Lowes and Home Depot but the expertise here is amazing.  You will not find people as experienced and helpful like this at the other big stores.\n\nThe only knock is that ultimately the selection is a fraction of what you would find at Lowes and Home Depot.\n\nFor 99% of stuff, you'll find me here."
Two,"You know I want to like this place as a restaurant but I can't, I just really can't. I went out earlier this week and I had a good time there but it's not a restaurant it's a good place to have some drinks and karaoke. Yes karaoke it has private rooms that you pay to use(rent per hour) with flat screens reminds me kind of japan in a diluted way. I think the interior is a bit over done but it works in a weird way. My friends and I shared a few dishes but like I said don't come her for the food TRUST ME.... I got kinda drunk had some fun as did my friends and the service was a bit blah but I know what I came for so its okay... I would like to give it 3 stars for having a good time but I can't because of the food... please don't hate me."
Four,"I was visiting from CA... my sister and her family... she arranged a family get together and wanted to try some place fun and different as well as support an independent local business.  She called the day prior and spoke with the owner and told him that we'd be bringing a large group over Saturday morning for breakfast/lunch.  We called when we were on our way and when we arrived, they had set-up for our party of 11.  We were going to sit on the patio but with 90+ degrees we opt'd for inside.  With large glass windows we will had a pretty good view of the runway though air traffic was low.  Coffee shop style setting with fun airplane decor.  We asked for breakfast and lunch menus... large item selection on both.  Our group ordered a mixture off of each menu and everyone was pleased... generous portions.  I had a BLAT... BIG sandwich... lots of bacon and avocado... fries on the side hot out of the fryer.  Great server (Chastity)... be sure to ask her last name :-)))  Also have a kid's menu, and the younger boys were able to select a toy airplane."
Five,"WOW! This place has THE best bagels, hands down. I could eat their bagels everyday! I usually just get a toasted egg bagel with plain cream cheese and it's ALWAYS perfect. Sometimes I add lox and it's tasty too. They have many varieties of bagels and cream cheeses to choose from. You can eat there or take them home. My husband always gets one of their bagel breakfast sandwiches and it is consistently good. I have been going there since 1999 and have NEVER been disappointed. If you want to finally try what a bagel should taste like (be prepared to be hooked on it) you need to come here."
Five,"""This dog park has alot to offer. It's large and spacious with 2 gated sections -one for  \active\"""" dogs, where I see larger pooches,  and one for passive dogs where I see smaller dogs, but some larger ones too.  it's clean, well kept, and inviting. Also a really great place to meet fellow loving dog owners. Even if you just want to walk your dog, there's a nice walking path and desert garden area. I never have an issue with parking either. Just a very pleasant way to spend some quality time with your furry friends.\n\nTip- make sure to clean up after your pet, or you might get mauled by a group of angry pet parents!"""""""
Four,"Don't get me wrong, we love this place for sure.  The Mac and Cheese is great and the Southwest dumpling things are A-mazing.  My husband is a fan of one of their pork dishes - we get the same thing every time.  The service is spotty for sure.  I suggest going and sitting at the bar whenever possible and DO NOT go with a large party and expect to get taken care of properly.  I was embarrassed a couple times when we have taken friends and out of town guests there after I raved up and down about it.  We just go by ourselves now but hey - at least the food makes up for the service :)"
Four,"I've been to this airport twice. Once on a layover to Vegas and more recently on a trip to Florida. So first of all, the aiport is nice, modern, and clean. \n\nI can't complain about that, and it's pretty damn huge as well. It's nice to have a lot of square footage, since sometimes layovers can take a few hours, but on the other hand it could completely suck if your layover only gives you a 10 minute time window. \n\nThe food court and various eateries are great and it's not too expensive either. \n\nThe only complaint I have is that the airline I traveled with  (American Airlines) moved the gates and they didn't inform the people sitting at the original gate. This was very unprofessional as I was on time for the correct gate and they didn't bother to announce it, causing me to miss my flight and a huge headache for the remainder of the trip."
Two,"""Mediocre at best.  My friend and I went for a late lunch and politely asked to be seated at a table (which were all open) and were told that they were for large parties only and we had to sit at the (crowded) bar. We were smooshed in between two people at the bar of the conveyor belt (and I mean....almost on their freakin' laps). As we sat there, we saw that there was a party of two being seated at one table a single customer at another. We were very taken aback by this. The prices are very inexpensive, as long as you keep track of what you are pulling from the belt. Each plate is priced based upon its color. They have the \price/color key\"""" in front of you at the bar. The sushi seems to come with four pieces on each plate. The fish isn't always the freshest, sometimes tasting grainy or with an overly fishy smell that comes with age. The service is lackluster, with unfriendly wait staff who clearly don't want to be there. We had to ask for our check several times and never received a drink refill. So disappointing, as the conveyor belt is a cool concept. I think I will stick to made-to-order sushi at Mikado from now on."""""""
Four,"Attended for Restaurant Week for the first time and enjoyed everything, from the decadent  yet relaxing decor, to the atmosphere, food, drink and attractive wait staff. I started off with a red wine spritzer, a first and oh so tasty, the antipasti appetizer plate, which was simply scrumptious! For dinner I had the rainbow trout with green beans and toasted almonds, which was so delicious I ate every bite and for dessert the carrot cake. I was too full to eat it, but had to try a bite to make sure the trifecta was complete. Everything exceeded expectations and I can't wait to go back!"
Five,"I have tried the other DIY dog\nWash spots and this place cannot\nbe beat.  \n\nGreat products, customer service and atmosphere. I take a 85 pound dog there at least once a month for a self\nWash. I reccomend the ultimate wash- it's so easy to get your best friend so fresh\nand so clean-clean. \n\nToday there was a minor malfunction with a hose during our wash. The owner asked about it and apologized for the problem and cut the price in half. Now THAT is class and taking care of customers. \n\nIn addition- they have a great selection of dog toys you will not find anywhere else. My bff LOVES the sea creature series of dog toys. \n\nLastly, if you ever want to give yourself\nA treat and have them wash your pup- they have amazing grooming professionals who know their stuff."
One,"The money-gram service fee is $14 meanwhile at Walmart only $9. \n\nThey using a phone call instead if a filling form which is I have to repeated the questions & the answers many times. \n\nThey only accepted cash, not debit card. So when I have to take the cash from the ATM near their door, it charged me $3. \n\nI had to do it coz I have no time to find Walmart,  otherwise I preferred to go to Walmart. It suck."
Two,"""Although I appreicated how quickly they were able to see my son when he broke his arm their competance was questionable.

Five,"My wife told me about this place and said she loved the food, so after a recent appointment we were free on a weekday and went there for lunch--not during the lunch rush.  Not many people there so we had our choice of tables.\n\nFor appetizers, we had the Roquefort Flammenkuchen, which is like a tiny pizza with melted blue cheese, small pieces of pear, crushed walnuts, mozzarella and sour cream on top.  It easily could feed one person, but we split it.  While small, it was rich, and very tasty with the various flavors.  We also got their garlic bread, which was a piece of French bread sliced vertically (in other words, it's not like you get part of a loaf) toasted with garlic butter and cheese.  It was very good, but expected more of a serving.\n\nFor entrees, we both got crepes.  I got the Mediterranee, which has 4-5 big sea scallops, delicately cooked and served with a sauce with saffron and cheese.  It was very good.  While not big, the richness of the sauce helped make it more filling.  There is also a little salad served on the side of the plate.  My wife got the Nordique, which is a similar plate except it has smoked salmon with a cream and cheese sauce.  I tasted that--yum!  What is very interesting about these crepes is that they are square with the edges folded over and made of buckwheat, which makes them a bit heartier.  \n\nThe dessert menu is very tempting with a variety of dessert crepes, but I felt we should do a fondue, so we got the chocolate fondue for 2.  The chocolate sauce is made from melted bittersweet chocolate mixed with whipping cream and kept gently heated.  There are little brownies, sliced strawberries, apples, and cream puffs to dip.  It was literally finger-licking good!\n\nNice touch: as the designated driver, I got a root beer, and was given a free refill without me asking.  My wife got a glass of wine from an extensive wine and beer list.\n\nThe waitress was very friendly, helpful, and gave us great service.  This place also has a comedy night and musical entertainment certain nights, too.\n\nThis is quite a gem...I will definitely be back.  One small nit: as some others have written, it can be quite expensive, especially with drinks and desserts."
Three,"Visiting my cuzzos in AZ for Memorial Day weekend, they took me to Joe's Real BBQ. The place itself is very nice, it's spacious and has ample seating. When we got there, there was a huge line that stretched out to the door, but an employee (who I'm pretty sure is Joe himself; he looked like the man on the logo)  came out and assured us that the wait was only 20 minutes or so. I felt assured after that.\n\nIf it's your first time, then I'd definitely recommend getting the BBQ Sampler Plate. It has good portions of ribs, chicken, pork, and beef so you can sample from everything.\n\nAlthough all my Arizonians relatives found Joe's BBQ to be delicious, I personally found Joe's to be less than stellar than some of the BBQ joints I've been to in California. For starters, they totally skimped on the BBQ sauce, and for me, when I eat BBQ, I NEED all that sauce to be smothering my meat. \n\nOne last note: Joe's Real BBQ gets the most points in my book for having cream soda. I'm a HUGE cream soda aficionado, and well, let's just say the highlight of my night was owning up the cream soda fountain. I killed it (though the same could be said for my bladder).\n\nJoe's BBQ is definitely nice for large family outings. You can talk, take your time, and just really chill here. But for real BBQ taste, I wouldn't say this is my first choice."
Four,"The food was solid. Nice chips and salsa, not too rich of beans, and the right amount of cheese. Ordered chorizo and eggs, bean and cheese burrito, carne asada tostada and an enchilada (just because we have to try an enchilada everywhere).\n\nChorizo and eggs - good but not great\nBean and Cheese burrito - not overly filled, so it could have had more\nCarne asada - Excellent!\nEnchilada - a very good enchilada (not on the menu, so make sure to ask)\n\n\nThe only problem was the service. There were only 2 people working, and the woman didn't speak english well enough so the chef had to come out and take orders. So he was obviously very busy and missed the side of rice we ordered. No fault to his own, he was doing everything, but it was something to note. We were thinking that maybe she fits more with the spanish speaking neighborhood, but for us it made it a little difficult to order."
One,"""Horrible experience and similar to others who have posted.  A $15K \3 week\"""" job was supposed to be completed in March 2012 and was not substantially completed until late June 2012.  We had to renegotiate and settle with them because they did not do what they were supposed to do.  Their design looked good on paper but was not even done to scale so when the crew did finally get started, what they had designed would not even translate to the site.  Their communications are awful.  Mark was supposed to be our project manager and he showed up only once during the 3 weeks that the job was supposed to be done.  James we were told has an ownership postion--told us only after we'd signed a contract that he lives in Colorado so was not available when we needed him to come to the site.  He seems only to communicate via email.  They provided spec sheets for us to choose materials and then substituted them for lesser grade materials.  They sold us 330 sf of flagstone but when we pointed out they had provided less than 200 sf, they actually wanted to argue that because they had layed them out 8 or 12 inches apart, that the area was 330 sf and that we still owed them.  Their plant materials were poor and tiny even though they had specified 1 gallon and 5 gallon plants.  We didn't get the quantities that were in the contract and 20% of ours have died.  We had a 90 day guarantee in our contract and notified them in August that we wanted them replaced.  To date they have not replaced them and they are no longer responsive. I can't think of a worse experience with a contractor."""""""
Three,"""Hob Nob's Coffee House and Gourmet Deli is what has emerged from the dust and smoke that once was the Willo House (one \w\"""", not two). Willo House was a Phoenix landmark beloved by many for its tremendous coffee, well-worn couches, and memories of Mary McCann's Poetry Slams--and loathed by others for its unmistakable smoke stench and vocally hung-over clientele.  So, like many CenPhos, I felt saddened  when I saw the \""""closed\"""" sign hung on Willo's door earlier this year, and I've been watching for this coffee interloper to open its doors. I've been hopeful that we'd find a new funky midtown establishment to add to Phoenix's growing reputation for goodness. \n\nFeeling emboldened and optimistic after voting on November 4th, Baby Oli and I stopped into Hob Nob's for a morning caffeine treat.  \nLet me begin by saying, holy moley, they got the smell of smoke out! I thought for sure that the odor of cloves and American Spirit would have permanently saturated the building's core.  In fact, there was not much at all inside to remind me of the Willo-that-was. They've knocked down walls to widen the space inside and painted in warm hues . The place now has what you might call \""""a d\u00e9cor.\"""" They said good-bye to funky and eclectic, and hello...hmm... Pottery Barn? \n\nI ordered an iced chai tea and a chocolate pastry. The chai was a chai, and the pastry was yummy, but not OMG-eat-here-this-instant yummy. The sandwich and salad menu looks awesome with sandwiches boasting of roast sirloin and \""""the finest long line caught Albacore tuna center cut all white meat.\""""  They also have some pretty impressive looking hand-made chocolates.\n\nI'm not going to lie, I do miss the old, lovingly run-down, Willo style. Hob Nob's felt a little too Scottsdale to me. I may be 100% wrong on this, but I don't think the owners of Hob Nob's are Phoenicians. The man who made my Chai had clearly never been to--or maybe even heard of--the original Willo, and wasn't interested in any jovial chit chat about the old locale, they spelled \""""Willo House\"""" incorrectly on their take-away menu, and the place simply doesn't have that Phoenix feel. \n\nRegardless of the Scottsdale vibe, I will go back to try those sandwiches, or maybe to test out their springy couches and fire place while grading essays. I'd love to toss them one more star! Fingers crossed that they'll relax a bit and make the most of their great location!"""""""
Five,"I've been coming here for YEARS (well, not this particular one, but you know what I mean) so it's a little surprising I haven't reviewed them yet! \n\nThis location is probably the best one I've been to-service is always awesome (44th & Thomas sucks with service, as does Camelback & the 51!), location is great-never had any issues with finding parking (unlike the one at Chandler mall = good luck!), and the food is always amazing! \n\nSo if you've never (**gasp**) been here before, it's pretty basic. They offer burritos, burrito & fajita bowls, salad bowls, and tacos (soft or hard, of course). Choose from chicken, steak, barbacoa, carnitas or vegitarian. Option of black or pinto bean. Salsa here is absolutely fantastic!! I ALWAYS get the corn & pico but they have a couple other options for those that like spicier. Obviously cheese, lettuce, sour cream, and guac are available to top it all off. \n\nI always get the same thing- steak burrito bowl (no rice) with black beans, corn & pico salsa, cheese, and guacamole. My mouth is watering just THINKING about it and I just ate here yesterday!! \n\nI love that they offer beer & margaritas in addition to the soda option-some days it's just necessary\n\nThe ONLY thing that annoys me (just a little) is that EVERY time I ask for guac, they inform me that it's $1.80 extra and is that ok? ugh. Obviously they musta had someone complain about not knowing, but seriously?"
Three,"I have only been here once and I ordered a Turkey Burger thinking I couldn't go wrong, BUT I was.  I felt like it needed a lot of SALT and other seasoning.  Honestly, it tasted like cardboard! The unsalted, unseasoned sweet potatoes were just as bad.\n\nIt was just OK for an organic entr\u00e9e.  I guess you just have to either change your mentality, life style or be a vegan to enjoy this place.  \n\nThis is a FOX concept, so expect a clean modern decor."

Three,"I'm giving Aunt Chilada's a 3. Its ok. The service is ok. \n\nWe went here this past weekend with a group of about 25 people. They sat us at 3 different tables. We asked our server if each table could have its own tab, so it would be easier for us and them to figure out at the end....they said no. Lovely. Luckily there was an atm in the bar area so we were able to pull out cash. \n\nThe food came out faster then expected with such a large group. Mine was decent, though I ordered a cheese enchilada and they gave me chicken and never came back to ask how our food was :( BUT I also ordered a green corn tamale AND a beef taco (Leave me alone, I worked all day and was hungry as all hell) Those were both way super tasty. \n\nI do have big beef with their chips. They suck. Who wants flaky not so crispy chips for dipping in salsa...not me. I want my chips crispy, thin and crunchy thank you very much. \n\nThe margaritas were good, they got me sauced. \n\nI wouldn't ask to go back, but if someone suggested going, I wouldn't put up a stink. Its ok."
Five,"I go here for the 3-D movies.  They are in REAL3D.  Better than any other Cinema.  I also like going in to see a movie in the evening and coming out to see all these old school cars lined up in the street.  I get my movie date and my husband gets his car fix.  This place is great for family, singles, and dates.\n\nThe seats are comfy and large for my big booty and easy to snuggle up to my hubby.  The place is always clean and has great quality picture and sound.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE:  They take Harkins Cups for refills!"
Three,"This will be a quickie. I stopped in last night with a friend to see if this place was any good and worth checking out again. We had already eaten, so we just had chips and salsa and a margarita. I plan on returning to sample the menu, but until then I'm giving this a pass fail sort of review.\n\nIt passed.\n\nService was good and the place is nice inside. The chips and salsa were okay. I wasn't blown away by the salsa, but I enjoyed it. That's more than I can say for most places. The house margarita was merely okay as well. Nothing special. It was served in a stupid shaped glass which was annoying, but I drank it and can't complain.\n\nI'll return sometime soon for a full meal, but I'm not going to bank on this place topping my list of great Mexican food. The search continues."
Four,"""Stopped by this week to check out their Christmas cookies.

My mouth is watering as I'm thinking about the Hog Heaven special.  In fact, my puppies mouths are watering too.  Decent prices, giant selection.  One of those places where the early cowboys of the SW would appreciate.  \n \nIf you are a cracker family, I suggest going super early, like super early bird special early , like when the snow birds come out for the senior special early, because after dusk, the whole place transforms into a pulsating super loud, super dicey Mexican Dance Club, and the blue hairs are sure to have a coronary attack after indulging in such a  lipid laden meal as they attempt to make their way out of the Club.  \n \nAh the sacrifice for decent BBQ...."
Two,Typical airport bar but this one is located in the slummy old school terminal 2 in Sky Harbor. I was there early in the AM and was the only person sitting at the bar and didnt get the best of service. Its almost like because its 7AM theres not going to be anybody at the bar pounding beers on the companies dime. Well she didnt get a great tip which I usually give after getting sauced up. \n\nOn the plus side lots of local sports teams memorabilia on the
Three,"I signed up for the Keg Birthday Club, they give you a free sirloin dinner! The server was prompt, knowledgeable, and courteous. The ambiance is very nice. The bread is delicious! Having that said, the steak is the only thing I didn't finish... I couldn't bring myself to say anything because it was free, but it was overcooked, sort of dry-chewy with too much charred goodness on the outside that overwhelmed the flavor. The veggies, shrimps, scallops, pilaf, salad, and everything else we had was delicious, but the keg is a steakhouse so......\n At any rate it was a free meal so I can't really complain but the promotion did not serve its purpose because I wasn't impressed enough to get a good impression overall.\n  I just changed it from 2 star to three star because I just remembered the hostess was pretty damn F-I-N-E, even my girlfriend thought so.  =)"
Two,"First, I was happy to just be away, ALONE, with my husband!  So right away the night started out positive.\n\nWe had done a little shopping at Last Chance and needed a bite to eat.  We are not that familiar with the Biltmore area so we just happened to pick True Food.  It looked busy (a good sign of a good place to eat), it looked healthy (got that from the name), and it appeared to be casual.  Exactly what we were looking for!\n\nThe service was just OK.  One funny thing happened, our waiter walked right into the glass door of the private room.  Don't worry, he wasn't hurt.  He brought us the wrong salad.  He took away my knife and brought me a fork replacement instead of a knife.  He did have one great recommendation....the hummas appetizer.  This was fantastic.  We did need extra pita bread.\n\nWe split the chopped greek salad with chicken.  It tasted great; however, the portion was crazy small for the $12 price.\n\nFor our entree we split (bad idea) the butternut squash raviolis.  We each got 2 raviolis.  The taste was just OK.  Our server highly recommended this dish to us.  Not sure why.  \n\nOver all the portion sizes are ridiculously small.  The table next to us agreed.  The LOVED their soup and apple crisp dessert but nothing else.  \n\nSo if you go...get the hummas appetizer, soup and dessert and you may like it!  \n\nI did have a celebrity sighting while I was there!!!!  Big from Sex in the City was there having dinner with his wife."
Four,"""This is probably one of my favorite Tempe bars to go to, and I like it for a variety of reasons.  First off, I have yet to have a terrible server here, and even when the place has been packed it's a rarity that my beer reaches empty before they come around asking me and the table if they need anything else.  Secondly, the food here is pretty good as well.  Great apps, solid \Mexican\"""" offerings, and I always love a bar that has breakfast.  I've ridden my bike here on a Sunday morning to enjoy their breakfast burrito and I have not been disappointed.\n\nThe crowd here is always a variety from all walks of life, which I truly enjoy.  Their front patio is great since you get some great people watching opportunities, but you can't smoke there.  For the smokers, the back patio is a great option.  Very big and open and full of people hanging out enjoying the outdoors.\n\nThey have different specials each night, and the beer and a shot option for just $5 is a great way to kick the night off with a bang.  They also have plenty of TVs to watch the game, clean bathrooms, surprisingly nice \""""bouncer\""""/ID checkers, and plenty of beer options to keep even the biggest of beer snobs happy.  My advice to you is to drink away at the Tavern.  You won't be disappointed."""""""
Two,"Hmmm. Maybe I don't get TJ's in general. Maybe I'm so used to having too many options at the big chain grocery stores. I don't know but I'm not in love with Trader Joe's.\n\nI've been a few times and each time I leave feeling like I'm missing something. I know far too many people who rave and love Trader Joe's, so I go walking in expecting to find something, anything that will just blow me away. It hasn't happened yet.\n\nThe last several occasions haven't helped either. The produce was severely lacking when I went (bruised fruits and no tomatoes!), I wasn't impressed with the taste of the frozen meals (bland!), and my husband is a huge milk drinker and I have a hard time stomaching the $6 price tag I paid. \n\nMost people love the wine selection. So cheap and tasty they tell me. Well, to be quite honest like Kristin S. mentioned, it was disorganized. I don't expect to be handed a bottle and told what to drink but I don't want to hunt either.\n\nMaybe I need someone to go with me. Show me first hand the joy's to Trader Joes. Until then, I'll keep on shopping at Sprouts. It's more my speed."
Four,This is my REI of  choice in the Valley.  Mostly due to its proximity.  But I have been coming to this location since I lived in the wilds of Northern AZ and would make my way into the valley on the occasional escape to socialize.

Five,"Fabulous Spring Training/ St. Patrick's Day/ Birthday weekend! I personally loved everything about this hotel. The location is unbeatable - walking distance from everything you can imagine doing in Scottsdale. I loved the colors and decor. My boyfriend asked for an upgrade since it was my birthday and they really went above and beyond to make me feel special. Not only did they upgrade us to a beautiful, spacious suite, they also comped our drinks and apps and gave me flowers and a card! I honestly was extremely impressed with their customer service. I am a Spring Training junkie and will definitely go back every year and stay at The Saguaro!"
Five,"This place is simply amazing!  I wish every breakfast place would model themselves after AZ Bread Co!  This place is ultra bright and cheery, which is so perfect for the morning.  There are tons of tables and chairs, so you'll be hard pressed to not find a seat.  The ordering system is perfect for breakfast, you place your order, get a number, and sit down.  The drinks are self serve so it's really nice to not have to wait for any servers when you are STARVING like I always am at breakfast time.  Everyone who works here is quick and efficient, running like a well oiled machine.\n\nNow the food....  Do yourself a HUGE favor and get over here on the weekend!  They advertise a pecan waffle, pancake, or french toast special here on yelp.  I decided I would have that.  BEST DECISION EVER!  It was so amazingly good.  The waffle was fluffy and sweet and the pecan compote was dreamy.  Just imagine loads of caramelly sweet crunchiness covering an already perfect waffle.  Are you in heaven now?  You should be.  I promise it will be mind blowing.\n\nI kind of love this place, as if you couldn't tell already.  I am going to be trying to find excuses to make our way down here more often!"

I'm not a big burger fan, but I got the bacon cheese burger... so good. yum yum. So, like I said, not a big burger fan, so I was thinkin.. maybe I will just give this place a four just based on the fact that I simply love Two Hippies and maybe people would think I was lying. But then I tasted their hot dog. Oh. My. the bacon.. who else didn't know that bacon could come in anything other than strips, all wavey-like? And it was HUGE!

Five,"I've been taking two households of pets to Dr. Sam Wolf since the clinic first opened (for over 5-6 years now.)  He is a WONDERFUL VET! Dr. Sam is the most thorough vet I have found.  Whenever I bring my dogs or my parents cats in, he always takes his time when doing an exam rather than skipping that step and getting right to the issue.  Each exam he checks over the entire body of the pet, eyes, ears, nose, throat, teeth ect. I have had him help me with trivial issues such as minor infections, and routine stuff all the way up to extreme cases of ear mites, flea dermatitis, liver disease in my cat when she was dying, and recovery from a major operation after my moms cat was brutally cut open.  Dr. Sam is alway conscientious of my budget while giving great care to my pets.  He truly cares most about the wellbeing of the animal rather than capitalizing on each client.  With each issue he will list the options of care with a budget in mind.  If there is a more affordable option that will help as much as a more expensive one he won't hesitate to share it. Whenever I call with a concern the office staff is alway extremely courteous and takes the time to check with the technicians or vets to get answers to my questions.  This clinic doesn't skip steps or hustle you around, I can't emphasize enough how much I believe they all truly care about the needs of each animal and helping educate each client on with each issue that arises.  \n\nMy family and I have spent many years in Phoenix with pets and we haven't found a better vet than Dr. Sam.  I have since moved to San Diego and I love him as my dogs vet so much that I return to Phoenix for non-emergent issues when I can because I trust my dogs (also known as my children) care in his hands more than anyone."
Two,"""I had Sprinkles cupcakes for the first time last night.\n\nI felt it was a complete meh experience. Maybe I'm just not a cupcake kind of guy.

Four,"I just finished up a gift certificate to Yoga Pura (5 sessions). Most of it was used on a Yin Yoga class (Monday nights at 7:30). Yin Yoga involves mostly stretching focusing mostly on your spine and hips. Postures are held for anywhere from 3-10 minutes. Nyla, the instructor, is such a peaceful, calming influence. I was so impressed with the fact that she noticed I was new to her class right away and yet she made me feel completely welcome. \n\nI also attended a flow class one Saturday morning. I've done vinyasa yoga before but never been exposed to binding positions. I found this class to be more challenging, but still enjoyable. Next time, I'll introduce myself to the instructor in advance and be sure to pick a spot where I can see better. \n\nThe only reason I took off a star is because the rooms are often stinky from the sweaty folks in the class before. A sign of a good workout, but I wish they would try to air them out a bit between sessions. AND, because, I was really only interested in the flow and yin (once I tried it) classes and I found the limited offerings difficult to work into my schedule.\n\nStill, I'm glad to have discovered this sanctuary for the mind and spirit so close to home!

Five,"This is one of the best entertainment values in town and I look forward to its arrival every April.  If you have not yet checked out the local improv community here in Phoenix you will be surprised at all of the offerings by various groups affiliated with the Torch Theatre.  (check their website for year round performance info.)  \n\nFor the annual Phoenix Improv Festival at the Herberger Theater, they jury in the best groups from around the United States for one action packed weekend.  All you have to do is show up at the theater (well, get tickets first of course) and you'll have an opportunity to see some of the most interesting improv groups from around the USA all without spending a minute waiting for a flight out of sky harbor airport.  Get ready to stretch your perceptions of what improv is, as these groups have so many different takes on it.  Some will make you laugh, others will be wickedly irreverent or will amaze you with their talents at weaving a cohesive story line.  Still others will have you thinking about them a month or longer after seeing their performance because of all the subtle intricacies woven in.  \n\nPhoenix's veteran improv groups frequently travel to other major cities to perform and have a key role in teaching and mentoring some of the up and coming local groups participating in the festival.  What a great opportunity for all to share the stage with groups from outside AZ and interact offstage.  fantastic learning opportunities that will only make the Phoenix improv community continue to grow better and stronger and deeper. They have a fantastic vision that's come so far and deserves our continued support!"
Four,"Located in a non-assuming industrial strip mall, Sleepy Dog Brewing is worth the effort to find. Lets be clear- its no Four Peaks or Gordon Beirsch in terms of food and amenities. But the beer is well-made and priced well, and popcorn is free. So, no- they don't have much of a kitchen (hummus and some small snacks are available) and frankly, I was a little surprised that the bartender didn't know more about the beers (even though she otherwise gave great customer service) but the beer itself makes all those other issues disappear. The Red Rover Irish Red first got me to the brewery because I first tried it at another bar and loved it. Its hard to find a good Irish Red in Phoenix. But the Leg Humper Hefewiezen kept me there with its clean, easy drinking taste. Its a more refined version of San Tan brewery's Hefeweizen, which can be a bit heavy for me. The seasonal dunkelweisse was also something I didn't expect to find in Phoenix and it was smooth and delicious. (Coming from Philadelphia, I'm used to a more extensive local beer selection). Finally, the Wet Snout Milk Stout was also a favorite of mine. It had a surprising complexity of taste. So much so, that I still cant pinpoint what the flavor notes I tasted were. All I know, is that it was good!\nFor food, they are partnering with the local food trucks (which is also a reason I went) so that they can provide dinner to their customers. Its a WIN-WIN deal, I think."
Five,"Fancy pants meets working class watering hole.  I've visited this spot a few times via friend recommendation on the food.  \n\nPork belly is amazing, shrimp pasta is surprisingly creamy and flavored with garlic and deliciousness.  Mussels are to die for!  \n\nWhat really got me about CPH is the gathering of every day people just wanting to enjoy a drink.  If you're in the service industry this bar will be a second home for you!  In spite of it's romantic feel, candle lit tables and linen tablecloths; you will feel right at home with the friendliest bartenders in Old Town.  \n\nNot pretentious but could be if it wanted to."
Two,"I realize the review page says Hula is not a place for kids but since it was 1:00, in the p.m. I figured my husb. and I could give it a try with our 3 year old and not give anyone a heart attack.  Mosly elderly folks at this time of day.  We were greeted timely enough and allowed to sit where we pleased.  Chose the booth seat against mirrored wall.  Our boy was well behaved, only a little loud happy talking here and there.  He coiored with crayons and paper that we brought.  Stayed at the table with us.  \n\nWe were not told someone will be with you in a moment by other server who tended to others for about 5 minutes.  When our server came, we ordered tea, water, a fancy juice for our boy and shrimp rolls.  \n\nShrimp rolls came before drinks.  They were crispy on outside but filled with imitation crab and only a few bits of shrimp.  Good sauce.\n\nTea and water came and then then a few minutes later the juice.  The boy enjoyed a big juice with cerrries, oranges, and an umbrella.\n\nHusb. ordered a fish dinner with sweet potato fries, ceasar salad and mac n' cheese for our boy.  Would share.\n\nIt was a LONG time before main food finally came.  I asked about it as we all were getting antsy.  Server told us that it would be less than 5 minutes as they were waiting on the mac n' cheese.  She said sandwich (we didn't order a sandwich but we took it anyway) was ready and did we want it now, before the mac n' cheese.  Yes!\n\nSandwich and fries came out COLD and the salad came out warm.  All three tasty though.  Mac n' cheese came too and it was NOT hot.\n\nAll in all, maybe they didn't like that we had a 3 year old with us.  There was a group of young twentish girls giving us the eye.\n\nDon't worry, we'll never take him there again.  Not sure if I'll even go with girlfriends for happy hour."
Four,"""I have wanted to go to the Stockyard, but had not previously had the pleasure. I don't want to drive back toward work and try a pricey restaurant that might not be worth the trip. Rachael Ray recommends trying a place for lunch when it is cheaper and less of a wait - so that is what I did today. One area where Rachael's advice was incorrect was the wait - Friday during lunch was very busy. When I entered the host recommended that I go to the bar because the dining area was already full. The bar contains seating as well as seats at the bar itself.  With the available seating taken, I bellied up to the bar at looked over the lunch menu. A positive note is that the menu is the same in the bar as the dining room. Being during work hours I could not enjoy items from the behind the bar, but the guys just down the bar from me were ordering and I was excited to learn the Stockyard has Moose Drool on tap. Instead, I had the diet Pepsi.\n\nWhen the waitress asked if I was ready and I indicated not yet, I didn't realize that might be my only opportunity. I imagined she would only serve those at the bar; however, she also worked the room behind the bar and was constantly running back and forth. It took about 15-20 minutes, but eventually she returned to take my order. I went with the Grilled New York Strip Steak Sandwich. I don't know if the recession has caused a bread shortage, it is homage to Dr. Atkins or Webster has changed the definition of \sandwich\"""", but typically I picture two pieces of bread surrounding the integral ingredient. Last week @ Robbie Fox's I was surprised that a sandwich came open faced. With the Stockyard menu providing a heading of \""""Sandwiches\"""" and the brisket sandwich being called \""""Open Faced BBQ Beef Brisket\"""", I foolishly assumed the other items not named \""""Open Faced\"""" would have two pieces of bread. Not so. The sandwich arrived in about 10 minutes and was served on a single piece of bread with a side order of fries. Hmmm. That said, it was a regular sized steak - and for $15 a descent price. The steak itself was among the best I have ever tried. Tender, juicy and flavorful. The fries were crisp and tasty. \n\nAlthough I am not a fan of Westerns, the bar had a nice feel. A copper cash register in the back corner with a picture of John Wayne to the waitress' attire and appearance screamed Old West. It had a nice feel. I don't blame the waitress for slow service because she was hustling the entire time. I think management needs to monitor customer flow and if it is busy on a Friday afternoon, there should be a server working that room and letting the bartender focus on  the bar and the libations. \n\nThe dinner menu escalates in price, but given what I had for lunch, the history and the atmosphere, I would like to come back and experience dinner in the dining room or maybe spend a quiet evening at the bar enjoying a Moose Drool or two."""""""
Five,"We have never had a bad thing to eat here.  Oh, I take that back. Over the years, things can't be perfect but on that rare occasion that something wasn't right or didn't live up to our expectation, apologies were made and the issue corrected.   Tonight, I had the pastrami sliders and a caesar salad..  the pastrami was fjantastic, not at all fatty. I was served 4 sandwiches which was a surprise based on the price and past experiences. I had only expected 3.  \nGlad we stopped in again and I know we'll be back again."
Five,"Fantastic. I usually go for quick street food when it comes to Greek, but I wanted a nice relaxing meal. Had to order the lamb souvlaki because, you know, lamb. Ordered it medium rare and it came cooked to perfection. Juicy and tender and well seasoned. Impressed, as most places screw up cooking such small pieces of meat. Not these guys! Lemon potatoes were also excellent and the side salad was the tastiest I've had at any Greek joint. I feel like they used a quality olive oil...and the generous amount of feta didn't hurt! Wish I had room for an appetizer or dessert. Will definitely come back here the next time I'm visiting AZ. \nThe only negative is just a pet peeve of mine from my beer snobbery - good beer served in an ice cold glass. Cold kills the flavor and they have some good stuff on tap, a shame."
One,"The big burrito is a filibertos type joint that specializes in that drunk carne asada/rolled taco fair.  There used to be one on 19th and Dunlap.  I vaguely remember going to the one on Dunlap and thinking it was okay.  Of course, this was very late in the night/early in the morning.\n\nThe new one on TBird is where the Burrito Bandito used to be.  We ordered a carne asada burro, 3 rolled tacos w/ cheese, beans, guac, and cheese enchiladas.  The carne asada was disgusting.  It was marinated very poorly.  The flavor was bland and dull.  The meat was heavily chopped.  It was so chopped you could barely even make out it was carne asada.  The rolled tacos were covered in a waxy cheese glump.  Not sure what kind of cheese they used but it was basically a soft candle wax that clumped together.  The beans were so thin they were like applesauce.  The guac was average.  The cheese enchiladas were probably the best out everything but still no good.\n\nI would have to say stick to big burrito on those late night/early morning runs only.  The food is no bueno."
Four,"We hadn't been out for breakfast in quite some time, so yesterday I convinced my hubby we needed to go & he agreed. I had bookmarked a couple places on here & we decided to give Tiny's a try. \n\nOur waitress was a sweet lady & promptly took our drink orders. No coffee for us, hubs got o.j. & I got apple juice. After looking over the menu, I decided on the french toast, side of bacon, & the specialty hash browns. Hubby got the chef's omelette that came with hash browns & toast. The french toast was simple & a small portion but that was perfect for me, I loved it! The bacon was tasty & the hash browns were amazing-in addition to potatoes it also had onions, cheese, & a dollop of sour cream on top, delish! Hubby's omelette was huge so he could only finish half but he said it was yummy & he finished the hash browns & toast so that's always a good sign. \n\nOur total came to $25 & come change, not including tip. Not bad, not bad at all!\n\nWe will definitely come back for a Sunday breakfast. Especially in September, which is when the hostess informed us of their famous cinnamon buns being made then!"
Four,"Carl's Jr. is my office away from the office Monday thru Friday. I come here to read my IBD and grab something to eat. I love the french toast and when I'm feeling really cheap I get the Sunrise Croissant for a buck. The croissant comes with eggs, sausage and american cheese (I request pepperjack instead). Lately the Sunrise has not been agreeing with me so I guess I'm stuck with the french toast for now on. So come by and say hello if you're in the area before 8:30."
Two,"just wanted to chime in & say that this place is so vegetarian-UN-friendly it's not even funny. I was dragged here with family & ended up ordering a chile relleno, which was just about the only meatless item on the menu, short of a fucking cheese crisp.\n\nit wasn't terrible, but this place is really just all kinds of lame. service was mediocre, food was mediocre. with as many awesome & authentic mexican restaurants as there are in the valley, there's no reason on earth to come back, except MAYBE to try a mango margarita."
One,"HORRIBLE... underscore HORRIBLE.  While visiting Scottsdale we happened upon the Culinary Dropout on the corner of an upscale shopping area.  Our waiter highly recommened the Fried Chicken and the Rainbow Trout.  UGH!   The Fried Chicken was too greasy and upon slicing into a piece a river of grease poured out.   My rainbow trout was dry and overcooked with a hard crust on the outside.  It required using a knife to cut into the fish... who ever heard of such a need with a delictable fish.  On top of the fish were green beans from your grocers freezer section and a handful of sliced almonds and voila!!! you have a $19.00 dish without flavor, delicate  texture, and care in the cooking.  These dropouts should be fired or sent to retake  their highschool Home Economics class. I give this restaurant a thumbs down .  There are so many other wonderful restaurants in Scottsdale with fun ambiance to enjoy.... don't bother stopping here."

Three,"If you are looking for a great place to celebrate a birthday or you have a big group, this place is awesome. You totally can order family style and the service is on point. Also, it is out of the ordinary.\n\nHowever, it would not be my first choice for Chinese food. Do not get me wrong it taste good, but it is too Americanized. I rather get my Chinese food greasy and salty.\n\nIf you save room for dessert, you should definitely taste the Banana Spring Rolls. They are delicious."
Four,"we came here with a group that i work with.  I am very impressed with the architecture and decor.  our waiter was a young man named sam (I am) who was very entertaining and knowledgeable.  He suggested a tequila I had never heard of, it was very good.\n\ni shared the pork shoulder, thinking it would be huge, but it was not that much food.  still, very high quality and many new flavors.  \n\nas with other reviewers i am completely addicted to the pumpkin pudding.\n\nfor those of you who like tequila, this is the place.  i think i counted about four dozen different kinds.  (but no jose Cuervo reserva de familia, the very best in all the land!)....also flights of tequila so you can sample.\n\naltogether, the mission is a delight, especially if others are footing the bill!\n\nmike"
Five,"A nice place to grab a coffee and a treat and do geeking on the internet. A great drive-thru option if you can't stay. Megan, the manager, has staffed enough folks behind the counter now to wait on the drive-thru and walkins. They even bring you your order if they can! Also they have a foursquare Mayor contest. Large place indoors and out, cool artwork on the walls, free wi-fi (ask for the password slip when you order) and good background music!"
Four,"Finally getting to write my review, can let my better half get ahead of me. We ended up at this place thanks to Groupon, so prices were certainly acceptable, but even then, we'll certainly come back with a group.\n\nTHE FOOD\n\nBeing a gourmand extraordinaire, I ordered... a chicken sandwich. And it was good. Nothing spectacular due to the nature of it being a chicken sandwich, but I had nothing to complain about. The meat was juicy, the bread and greens were fresh. We also ordered calamari for appetizer. They were small by my hungry food per dollar measurement, but again, properly done and not fried to hell like some places like to do. To top it off, the place has lambics, which in itself is awesome.\n\nSETTING\n\nThe restaurant appears to be made up of three distinct areas. At the entrance from the street you have a dining and bar area, a bit deeper and adjacent to the spa is an almost separate dining area (better lit by the daylight) and then you have the very large patio. Unfortunately the weather was too hot for us to be outside, but the inside was rather nice. One of these times will have to bring a few friends over for the patio portion, the view is rather good.\n\nSERVICE\n\nOverall good, if a little overbearingly pleasant.\n\nOTHER\n\nCan get a little confusing with finding the entrance at first."
Four,"My husband and I stayed at this Embassy Suites for a business meeting held right here. It's easy to access by getting off I-17, driving east and very quickly turning down the first street on the south side of Greenway. Check in was easy, and the lobby has a neat kiva-like roofline and a tateful Native American theme. Finding the room was a little challenging. The building goes long and deep and then wraps around. The grounds are beautiful on the inside, as it's an older property. It is kept up pretty well, complete with pool and a large fountain. The room numbering system is a bit tricky. Some other visitors helped direct me--the signs were not clear to me. It's a good hike to the back rooms, where we stayed. But you can drive around and park near the back, and access the rooms that way, too. The rooms are accessed from outside door entry.\n\nThe room decorating seemed pretty fresh and new, and the bed was very comfortable, with good-quality sheets and cover. Everything was clean and well kept. The facilities were modern, with a flat screen TV in the suite part and in the bedroom (I love that feature of having two rooms in Embassy Suites). The entry room featured a small living room area, telephone/internet/desk area and a small fridge, which worked fine, with a huge counter space.\n\nThe best part was the breakfast, which was generous and full of variety. And it featured a very friendly chef who was eager to please. You'll find fresh ingredients for an omlette, plus scrambled eggs, bacon, potatoes, breads, bagels, danishes  and muffins (all the good carb stuff), the butters and toppings for those good ol' carbs and great juices and coffee, too. There's fruits, yogurts, cereals and other goodies on the buffet. Seating was generous, with a number of areas from which to choose. I made sure I tried a good portion of that variety, too! First class breakfast--which is included in Embassy Suite stays.\n\nThe meeting room is a good size with easy access from a few different doors. Light and cheerful--can configure it a variety of ways.\n\nI filled out a survey for this hotel, like most hotels do these days. One difference: the manager actually followed up with me personally by email to make sure he was on track with my comments (I had mentioned that the meeting room sound had a little glitch on the sound AV settings). That was impressive follow up and indicates a caring management. I liked that."
Three,"Filiberto's can be hit or miss depending on the location. This is my second-favorite location. My favorite thing on the menu is the carne asada fries without guac (I hate guac anyway, but there's tends to be super runny... yuck) and it is absolutely fantastic in a really guilty pleasure sort of way. My second favorite thing is the green chile plate (pork) and I always get a second tortilla. My boyfriend gets the two beef taco plate and I really like it too. \n\nOne thing to note is that if you order a burrito or a quesadilla (one of the plain ones, not one of the fancy ones likes the carne asada) they usually don't come with ANYTHING in them besides meat and the listed veggies. No cheese, sour cream, etc. You have to get it on the side. Which is fine, but the first time I went to filibertos in high school I ordered the chicken burrito and it was good but it is literally just a tortilla stuffed with chicken in red sauce. I need some dairy in my burritos!\n\nI've never eaten inside here. I've never even ordered inside. I find that these places tend to be less clean than I would like so I just don't bother going in."
Four,"""Ummmmm.....cheap champagne in a cool, loungy atmosphere?  Yes please!  This place almost instantly made it to the top of my list of happy hour locations when we were presented with our first round of rose' champagne on the house, simply because I had a \membership card\"""" (free to anyone that requests it) and this was my first time using it!  (The membership card allows you to rack up points based on your bill at the end of each visit, and you can cash in those points for various perks). \n\nWe went on a Thursday, which is ladies night.  So even though happy hour typically lasts until 7 (and includes such things as $5 bubbles and half off well drinks), on Thursdays those prices are extended for the ladies until 8pm!!\n\nThe food also looked appetizing!  I snacked on some of the 'toasts' my friends ordered, and they were delicious!\n\nBasically, I plan to make this a regular Thursday night hangout, and can't wait to go again!"""""""
Four,"I can't say whether or not Blue Nile is better than Lalibela.  They both seem to have their pros and cons, which don't necessarily have to do with the food's flavor, but more so personal preferences on texture, price (Blue Nile is a bit pricier than Lalibela), and types of offerings (Blue Nile seems to have a more extensive menu than Lalibela).  Personally, I prefer to flavor and textures of Blue Nile but not so much to pay the difference in price.  So, I would choose Lalibela over Blue Nile."
Five,"Came out from LA to visit a friend here in Phoenix.... got off the plane and first stop: The Vig!!\n\nEverything on the menu looked so good... I couldnt decide... my friend said the Carne Asada was SUUUUUPER good. Sooooo, that's what I got and let me TELL YOU... it was BOMB. \n\nCarne Asada on a Potato Pancake: sliced carne asada on a potato pancake with guacamole, pico de gallo, sour cream, cotija cheese and roasted tomato sauce\n\nFor people familiar with the LA area.... this place has the same look, feel and vibe of Beechwood in Venice. \n\nGo here!! Its YUM!!"
Three,"Its what you expect, burgers and fries.\n\nBut wait, there is more now.  There are sweet potato fries.  Yes, you heard it here first - sweet potato fries - yum.\n\nI find the drinks fun to look at and yummy to drink but a bit on the pricey side.\n\nHere's another great hint - they have smaller portion burgers!  I can never finish the whole regular burger so this is a great deal.\n\nComfortable easy place to be.  Someday I'll save room for dessert."
Four,"I took my Fender Hot Rod Deville 4x10 tube amp into Ziggie's for repair on a serious noisy buzz coming loudly through the speakers (even louder than the guitar signal!) Before taking it in, I did everything in my ability to troubleshoot the issue on my own (I am very poor, you see). I had recently replaced the tubes (carefully, with the help of a professional), the buzz dd not improve, so having heard good reviews, Ziggie's was my next resort. \n\nThe repairman at Ziggie's was very kind, and knowledgeable. He assured me that it probably wasn't the new tubes I had installed (woo!) and that there was probably some short inside the circuitry of the amp. He had the amp for a three whole weeks (I had other options for live gigs luckily) and when I got it back, the amp was as good as new. The grand total was a $60. I sighed with relief, expecting the charge to be much higher. I'll most likely visit Ziggie's again with my next inevitable musical instrument problem."
Four,"Gelato... Yum.  When I visited Italy in college I was taken aback by how many people I saw eating gelato on the streets.  It was not just children but business men, professionals, old people, young people, green people, blue people.... everyone was enjoying this delicious treat!  After my first taste I knew why right away!\n\nGelato is like ice cream, but different.  I wont get into the recipe and what makes it different, all you need to know is it is GOOD!\n\nThe Gelato spot is the closest I have gotten to that same great experience I first had in Rome... fantastic, refreshing, tasty... so much like ice cream but so much more.\n\nI don't even know why I am bothering to review it though, everyone and their mailman has already discovered how great this place is!"
Four,"In town for a Spring Training trip and had a dinner at Pizzeria Bianco circled twice on the agenda.  I guess I should have figured that with every food critic/organization under the sun singing its praises that it might be a popular destination, but was still blown away when their hostess told me that my buddies and I were looking at a minimum 3 hour wait to get our hands on some of this famed pizza.\n\nBut wait!! They have a sister restaurant across town that serves EXACTLY the same pizza?  And we can essentially stroll in there with no problems?  Sign us up.  I'm also guessing this is reasonably new development because a lot of these reviews below me don't seem to even acknowledge the pizza's existence.  \n\nRight now they've got four options for pizza - the Marinara, Margherita, Rosa, and Biancoverde.  Our group of 7 tried all but the Marinara (no hard feelings, cheese-less pizza).  I was impressed with all three with the Biancoverde taking the crown as the best of the night.  One of the chefs there really took care to explain all of the fresh and locally-grown ingredients that they used, and you can tell that the entire staff really takes pride in the food they serve.\n\nWhy only four stars?  Fair or not, I'm afraid it just couldn't overcome the hype.  My buddy from New York INSISTED that he could find a handful of pizza places that could outdo this in NY (although talk about hype...).  If anyone has ever tried Pitfire Pizza in Los Angeles, Pane Bianco is like a better version of that...with a measure of distance there, to be sure.\n\nI'd still be sure to get off your butt and check it out if you've been struggling to come to grips with the zoo over at Pizzeria Bianco - I can't imagine this will remain a well-kept secret for long."
Five,"I try to buy all my cds at Zia simply to keep indie music stores like this in business. I spent many teenage hours flipping through the LPs at record stores in England and I would hate for the likes of Walmart (what were you thinking ACDC & Eagles?!?!?!) and itunes to become the only places I can buy music.\nI want selection, new, used, music mag's, tee shirts, posters, all the stuff that Zia does so well. \nStop buying music at the corporations and support Zia ... only when they are gone will you realize how much you miss places like this."
Four,"""For some reason I have never had a \full\"""" meal in the dining area the 2 times I have been here.  Instead, my wife and I have chosen to sit in the bar area because it is normally later in the evening when we go and we just want something quick and casual.  We normally just order a few things to share and here are some of our favs and un-favs:\n\n* The Steamers Clam Chowder - it is AWESOME!  They put both New England and Manhattan chowder in the same bowl.  Not mixed together though...on separate sides.\n\n* The Steamers Wedge - EXCELLENT and HUGE.\n\n* Rocky Point Shrimp Cocktail - I honestly don't think it is very good.  I think it lacks flavor and kick.  I would just stick to a regular shrimp cocktail in the future.\n\nThe service is always excellent as they are very fast and friendly.  The prices are on the high side but that's what you get for wanting decent seafood in the Biltmore area.\n\nAlthough I am always there way after happy hour has ended; the specials look awesome.  If I am ever in the area around happy hour time then I will definitely make a visit."""""""
Five,"The US Egg is awesome! I love their protein pancakes and their staff is very friendly. I've tried a few other things at this restaurant; however, if you've never been here before, the protein pancakes are a must!\n\nOnce when I was there my food came out wrong. I told the waitress that it was fine, and I would eat it. The manager/owner came over and apologized and comped my entire meal. I thought it was really great how they take care of their customers. I would recommend this place if you've never been there."
Three,"Ok, now this is my first time. I am qualifying this review to be fair as I am not a cultured eater. I am a steak, burger, salad (I have also ate other cultural foods, but this was the farthest out of my comfort zone that I have been). I have to say that the waitress was very helpful and the food was pretty good, again I am not used to Ethiopian food. The injera bread was alright, kind of a different taste. \nI was told about this place from some customers of mine and I decided to try it with my girlfriend. Now as I haven't given the old 5 star review of this, I will try this again. Maybe with a crowd or group of friends to try that experience. \nThe atmosphere was very comfortable and enjoyable and would recommend others at least try it out if you haven't already."
Four,"Yep, my Gas Buddy app confirms this is the lowest priced gas station in my zip code. I've been coming here ever since the ARCO on Price and Southern closed a year ago. The store is clean and the employees are friendly. It is open 24 hours/day and the car wash is just $5. I always pay cash for gas, so the fact that they don't take credit cards doesn't bother me at all and in fact probably explains why the gas prices are less expensive than other gas stations. \nA 24 hour Walgreens is right across the street. I love shopping at 4am (especially in our uber hot summers). So, it is not unusual for me to gas up, pick up a newspaper, and wash my car at 4am and then dash across the street and do some shopping at Walgreens and be back home before 5am! Awesome!"
Four,"We came for a late breakfast on Saturday.  The wait was about 15 minutes and we ended up sitting at the bar.  \n\nThe food was excellent (once we finally got it).  Try the Greek scramble if you want something packed with flavor.  The flannel (corned beef hash and potatoes) was delicious and pancakes are pretty good too.  Just don't come expecting to get you food quickly (it took about 30 minutes for our meals).\n\nSide Note:  I couldn't get any reception on my phone (I am with AT&T of course).  They have free wifi, but it won't help you make calls or send texts."
Four,"Having grown up in Hawaii, I have been around the freshest of the freshest seafood and am very picky when it comes to good sushi.  Having the freshest seafood is what makes great sushi and the Ritz Carlton's Bistro 24 has it.  I have tried other so called sushi places around Phoenix with terrible results.  However, on the bright side, I am thinking that maybe the Ritz isn't the only place that gets dibs on the freshest fish.  I am sure the Phoenician does, as well as all of the other top tier Resorts.  Then it gets trickled down to all of the other establishments in the Valley from highest to lowest...catch my drift?  Just a reminder, if you see a sushi place where there are Asians preparing it, jump on it.  I don't mean to put race into the mix by any means, nor do I think only Asians can create good sushi (the chef at the Ritz was Caucasian), but when it comes to sushi, it is really an art form, and unless it was passed down from generations before you or you went to the Culinary Institute of America....well, you know what I'm saying..."
Three,"Stopped by Daves Electric Brewerpub in Tempe AZ. on Monday, during my afternoon long pub crawl with Justin from Brew Bros. & a couple of mates.  Walked over to Dave's from Mellow Mushroom in the dead afternoon heat only to find that summer hours had taken effect and that they were closed. DRAG!\nAnyway, I peaked in and met bar manager Cristina who invited us in for a pint and treated us like kings despit the fact that they were not even open for business.  That was very cool.   She gave us a little background on the pub and their recent brewing activity which was nice as well.\nWe all had the Trident IPA, a bit malty for my taste as far as IPAs go but nice none the less.  A nice little place to check out while in downtown Tempe.  A great Pre Game Hang Out. Cheers."
Five,"""I had been wanting to come back for a while.  I love this restaurant.  Last night we had a magnificent meal.  I started with the St. Francis Lemonade, a perfect cocktail to start your meal.  There are so many wonderful choices.  They are featuring a special menu for New Years, however you can order from it \a la carte\"""", so we decided to start with the Arizona Citrus Salad.  It was delicious.  I love the combination of dates, goat cheese and orange slices.  I also chose from the special menu the sea scallops.  WOW, they were so sweet and tender.  They were served over a bed of black lentils, so amazing.  The portion was generous, 5 scallops, I am glad I didn't order the side of sweet corn polenta.  I ended up ordering dessert (yes my hubby twisted my arm, NOT).  I had the usual, Sticky Toffee Pudding and my hubby had the Chocolate Stout Cake.  I had a bite of his and it was great.  I cannot guarantee I won't stick to my usual dessert, but it was a closed one.  I wish this restaurant was closer to where I live.  It is such a great place."""""""

One,"If your buying a Mastercool evap from Home Depot do not have Delta Mechanical install it!   Less then a week after having Delta out a second time after installation and the Mastercool was supposably fine, it started making quite a bit of noise. I hired a heating & cooling company to see why the Mastercool was making so much noise. They found that it was not level, one side was an inch higher, the belt was too tight, the water level was too high causing a lot of water drainage out the pvc pipe.  Besides all of that they left the cookie tray laying up on the roof and didn't supply a customer care booklet nor the warranty card with the cooler.

For those who like to control the amount of topping you have, it's great.  For those who are indecisive or lack the ability to guesstimate the weight, this is bad.  \n\nMojo has a wide array of flavors available.  Here is the full list: Original Tart, Green Tea, Tart Strawberry, Passionfruit, Pomegranate, Wild Strawberry, Wild Blueberry, O.J., Mango, Lemon, Banana, Chocolate, Cookie, Vanilla, Latte, Plain, Bubblegum, Pistachio, Mint, Kahlua, Root Beer, and then there are even sugar free and fat free varieties.  To be indecisive and placed in this shop would be an awful situation.  It's best to go in here with a plan.  As for toppings, they offer something a little bit different than other yogurt places.  The options here are mostly fruit or candy with a few crunchy toppings thrown in for good measure.  \n\nI really like this place because I can make my ratio of yogurt to toppings 1:1.  Woohoo.  My husband won't ever go back here because he doesn't like the system of paying by weight.  Oh well, there is always Yogurberry for him."
Five,"Luv! Luv luv Retro Ranch! Fun Funky stuff for a reasonable price. I never leave without purchasing atleast a little something. Music is awesome thanks to the quirky sales staff. Service is friendly without being clingy. There is a ton of kitschy cool stuff and it takes a while to let it soak in. After the take over last year it is deffinitely a more fun atmosphere. Crazy awesome clothing section! I can deffinitely see why they got best of phoenix for that! It is smaller then Hollywood Regency but packed to the gills with great finds at shockingly low prices. I so want the red 70s Diane Von Furstenberg wrap dress! Vintage records and the retro stereo equipement to play it on. Who knew a stereo could be so sexy? Oh and please will somebody loan me money for the huge bamboo tiki bar? Put the Harry Belafonte record on, grab some of their groovy tiki mugs and the Mai Tai's are on me!"
One,I had been a customer for over 3 years at this UPS Store Location.  Customer in terms of holding a PMB (post Mail box) and shopping for odds and ends for shipping supplies.  After all my patronage I was late on a payment 1 week (because I was out of town) the owner charged me a late penalty fee.   Kept saying she has lots of customers and that she cant help me.  So I am taking my business elsewhere.  Keep your customers but not this one...
Five,"Awesome pizza.  It's a neat atmosphere, and one of the few restaurants that I don't feel to bad about taking my toddler into.  It took a while to get our order, but they were really busy when we went.  There were a line of people waiting outside the door.  We were also with a group.\n\nSince my initial review, I've been back to the Mellow Mushroom four times.  This place is definitely five stars.  The service has been very friendly and efficient, and the food just keeps getting better.  Initially I gave it four stars, because it took so long to get our order, but the past four visits have been much better in that area.  \nMy husband and I dined in their bar area late one night, and it was a great experience.  The bartenders (Keith and Jenna) were fantastic.  I don't think you'd find better bartenders in Phoenix.  They were friendly, and made a great drink.  They also have a late night menu that is more appealing than your normal late night pub fare."
Three,"""Ahhh, the politics of dive bar pool....\n\nHi, we're locals and we rule the school.

Four,"I'd been wanting to try this place for a while, and I finally was able to drag the wife there on a not-too-busy Friday night.\n\nThe #2 was quite good - have to love prosciutto on a burger - then adding pesto, well, that's MY burger. Get yer own.  Cooked to a perfect medium-rare as ordered as was the wife's medium-well version of #3 (green chile, jack, chipotle, hold-the-avocado). The burgers are Plenty Big - go easy on the sides unless you are starving. \n\nSpeaking of sides, the onion rings and sweet potato fries were both very nicely done - not greasy, and very hot! I tried the Guinness milkshake, which while good, is not something I need to get again. The Guinness lent a hint of greater depth than just a regular chocolate shake, and was fun for the novelty, but not enough of a difference to repeat. The wife's strawberry shake was VERY good, and probably the way I'll go next time. The shakes are provided with the mixing cup - so you actually have two full servings worth (might split one for two people)!\n\nAs for the overall ambiance, we enjoyed the decor with the French wallpaper (I think of toile as having pastoral scenes, and this was just patterned - but nice), the semi-dim lighting, metallic ceiling and general decor.  The only thing to detract was the screeching metal music playing. I don't mind contrasts - but this was discordant.\n\nThe value was alright - we expected premium prices for the premium burgers, and will return, I just doubt it will sit high in the rotation."
Five,"Casey Moore's has saved me from many a dull night. So far, it has been the only consistently great bar I've found in Tempe, in part due to the fact that the crowd is so chill and not too clicky. It is true that it's predominantly ASU students, but a pretty wide spectrum of them, and it seems so laid-back I would think it would be hard for most to feel too out of place. I don't feel like I've walked into someone's private party at Casey's, and I very much appreciate that. \n\nI've also got to give props to the well-made drinks, decent beer selection, friendly bouncers, and a surprisingly good bar menu. I've had excellent sandwiches here on a couple of occassions.\n\nOf course, Casey Moore's wouldn't be Casey Moore's if it wasn't for that fantastic huge patio that is a huge reason why bars out here can be so much for relaxing than in other climates. It doesn't matter how crowded it is or whether or not I can get a seat, I just love to walk around out there with my beer or martini, people watch (or fish watch), and lounge. No matter how crowded it gets though, the vibe stays easy and friendly, and in the winter hot and toasty as you (and sometimes some cool lizards) huddle around the heat lamps.  Always a good time."
Four,dog park has no drama. it has green grass. fun workout options around the lake.  I wish there was access to the water for the dogs but there is not. Parking lot is huge and always monitered. I almost got a ticket for not having my dog on a leash when walking from my truck to the dog park.\nI go here often and will continue too. doggy happy hour or the buisest times for doggy socializing appear to be 7pm and 5-6am
Two,"I went on a first date to Merc bar last night and, first off I have to say that the main reason I like the Merc bar is Shawn, the cute, flirty bartender from down-under.  Besides convenience being near the movie theater and a fun bartender, I find Merc less than desirable.  My main problem lies in the food.  There is a wonderful selection of cheeses and meats to choose from. However they are large servings and there is a minimum of 2 item purchase.  So, if there is only 2 people, you have to order a ton of cheese and it costs $24 minimum!  For this reason, I generally choose Houstons or M &C's nearby if I want an app with my drink.  How hard is it to make a smaller portion?"
Four,"Come hungry, leave full... of joy! haha.\n\nBeen here a few tymes and I still can't find a reason to NOT like it. This place is comfortable, friendly and satisfying. The food is great but the beer is better. Not your normal selection of drinks, they have a unique selection, which I like. HH has 2.50 drafts and they have about 8-10 diff choices so you can't go wrong, they'll have something you like. \n\nIt's also like a house-bar, which is neat because it makes you feel at home. Which also means you might wanna stay longer than anticipated. But you won't regret it."
Four,"Cooking can be fun, especially when someone else is doing it.  It also helps to have kitchen assistants who pre-chop, organize, and clean up afterward!\n\nThis is what I have decided after attending a recent class at Sur La Table, an event to highlight a few recipes from the Junior League of Phoenix cookbook Pomegranates and Prickly Pears.\n\nChef Dan was awesome - he worked the kichen area with speed and skill, preparing portions of the various recipies simultaneously.  We could see everything he was doing in a large mirror and on two TV screens.  Cooking, making jokes and answering our (sometimes ridiculous) questions all at the same time.  Since this was a demonstration rather than a hands-on class, all I had to do was sit back and enjoy each item as it was completed.  While I am not sure if I would try to make any of the dishes on my own (crepes look very difficult!) I did enjoy the tips & tricks he explained, including how to slice an onion without crying. \n\nAs an added bonus, after the class he found us wandering in the store (my friend was intent on taking advantage of the 15% off coupon) and offered us a sample of a new cookie recipe he was trying out.  Why yes, I'll take two!"
One,"Let's just say that if I could give less than one star I would.  I had ordered here once before and it took them 1 1/2 hours to deliver.They had given us the pizza for freeso  I decided to give them a second shot.  I ordered on a Tuesday night (not like a Friday or Saturday) and after over an hour I called them back and they stated that they couldn't find my address (keep in mind they had delivered to me before) and I live near major landmarks that any GPS can find.  Then afterI called and  read them the riot they said that I was out of their delivery area, but they were going to go out of their way and bring it to me.  As I am sitting here over 2 1/2 hours has gone by and STILL no pizza.  Neddless to say, I will not be ordering from here again."
Two,"""Let's get some clarification right now. This is NOT A COOKING CLASS, nor is it a place you can go to learn to cook. Instead, it is simply a place where they have a production line setup with various prepared ingredients and a few select recipes that change every month. You can go in there and \make dinner\"""" for your family in their kitchen, and then take it home and cook it. Voila! A \""""home cooked\"""" meal. For me, I was greatly disappointed that I basically learned nothing about cooking, and that I couldn't do anything on my own without the prepared ingredients and special process they use here. Plus, they simply sit you at a station and you do the steps noted in their recipe. While there is someone available to answer your questions, he or she is no \""""teacher\"""" and you are not in a cooking class. Unfortunately, various coupon specials have referred to it that way."""""""
One,"""I've been down to the Grimaldi's in Tucson, which was much better but still a tad overrated. This one, though, was not good at all. It was lunch on a weekday (i.e, not busy at all with maybe 10% of the tables occupied), but our pizza took more than 30 minutes to come out, and our server was slow and unattentive. When the pizza finally came, the crust was soggy  (so much for \coal-fired pizza) and there just wasn't much flavor. With drinks and the (undeserved) tip, the final bill was over $40, which is pretty steep for a subpar meal."""""""
Five,"I went here for my first time a few weeks ago. Originally I went here to get coupons to wet and wild but then decided to eat here as well. I'm glad I decided such a good choice, the service here was great. They asked if I was a new customer and was more than happy to tell me what to order and how things worked. There are a good selection of burgers and sides. \n\nI ordered the Bufallo Chicken burger with blue cheese and that was delicious. It wasn't too heavy and had that nice bufallo wing sauce kick! The shoe string fries I got as my side was great too! \n\nIf your looking for a good burger place, I would recommend this place. I would definitely come here again!"
One,"Do not go here unless you absolutely need to see a band.  I went last night, and luckily didn't have to pay for any tickets (I won them).  Venue is dirty beyond belief, like I don't want to touch anything for fear of disease dirty.  Hot, hot, hot, in a bad way.  If you are going to have a non smoking venue you need to enforce that, all kinds of people smoking on the concert floor.  Sound, was mediocre at best.  Parking was a rip off, and I don't think they even own the lot."

Three,"Alice Cooperstown is the place you want to go to once and then remember it fondly from a distance.  \n\nWalking inside you'll find that the wait staff is decked out with make up ala Alice Cooper.  The drinks are overpriced and seem to lack, well, alcohol.  Some of the menu items are good, others merely seem like a good idea at the time.  \n\nCase in point:  The Big Unit, a 1.5 foot long hot dog served rarely enough that the wait staff celebrates by sounding a buzzer when one is served.  Unfortunately I wanted onions and Relish with mine, which they tried to settle with relish packets.  I don't know if you've ever tried to spread 10 relish packets on a foot and a half long hot dog before, but it's not really a reasonable proposition.  (And of course, once you've finished 2/3rds of a 1.5 foot long hot dog, it honestly just isn't fun to eat anymore.)\n\nAs long as you can avoid the more ridiculous menu items the food is actually pretty excellent, if somewhat pricey.\n\nThe premises have 4 extremely large Big Screen televisions above the bar, a no-name brand ATM machine, smoking allowed outside away from entrances, excessively large t-shirt selection, and two levels of indoor seating as well as outdoor seating."
Five,"I have been to famous Dave's before, just not this specific location.  I came here for my birthday dinner on Saturday night, and was glad that I did!\n\nUpon entering, I was warmly greeted by the hostess.  I told her that my friend and I were here to celebrate my birthday, and she asked if we wanted to sit in the bar or at a table.  I chose the table of course!\n\nTravis was our waiter for the evening.  I  belong to the Famous Dave's P.I.G. club, so I had a birthday coupon for buy one entree, get the second one for free.  I told him this, and he said that I also get a free dessert since its my birthday.  FTW! YES! Who doesn't love free dessert?!?!? I DO!!\n\nAnyways, I went with the Brisket dinner, and my friend went with the 2 meat sampler. He got the BBQ'd chicken along with the sausage.  We both got corn on the cob, 2 sides each, (I went with the coleslaw and garlic mashed potato's) and my friend got something similar.\n\nO, and the Brisket? Done PERFECTLY as always!

Two,"The good, fun for kids. My daughter enjoyed her Dino shaped nuggets.\n\nThe bad, prices are high for value/food, and you have to walk thru the gift shop on your way out.\n\nThe ugly, poor service. The hostess walked around and kept us waiting for 10 minutes in a virtually empty restaurant. She did not greet us, tell us to have a nice meal or say thanks you on our way out. Really a glum, sloth like woman who would best serve this restaurant by washing dishes....far away from people."
One,"When it's 11:30 pm and me so hungry... I need a burrito call.\n\nAmando's Bros. sounded like it might satisfy my hungriness but this late night burrito call left me with regret.\n\nThe carne asada burrito was COLD. I had both hands wrapped on a cold burrito. It was such a turn off. I also had the carne asada fries that were equally disappointing. It was covered in cheese and the fries tasted like it was fried in lukewarm oil. It was not crispy or crunchy, just stale and old tasting. \n\nThe next time I am feeling an itch for a burrito late at night... I will have to pass on Amando's Bros. La comida es no bueno."
Five,"Local, Fresh and Friendly. More like walking into your own dining room. Except no pots and pans to clean up afterwards.  Locally sourced foods and prepared with with loving care. The waitress is always friendly and helpful in what to order. Small menu but enough variety to come back every week and not be bored by the selections. Owner is around and checking on the food. SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL MOM AND POP RESTAURANT ! Go and have a good Breakfast or Lunch. You will not be disappointed !"
Four,"I was in town for a friend's wedding and ended up sharing a room here with a couple of high school friends.  I made a reservation online initially but then had to call in and switch it to a wheelchair accessible room with a roll-in shower, add a night to the reservation, and add my friends' names to the reservation so they could check in before I got there.  The folks I talked to were very friendly and helpful and everything went smoothly -- we got the room we wanted and all was well.\n\nBonus points for them remembering our complicated plan of splitting the bill (one person pays one night and then three people split the remaining two nights) and providing us three separate bills before checkout time without us asking.    \n\nWireless internet has a daily charge of $9.95 but they told us if you hook up via wired Ethernet, the charge won't appear on the bill, and indeed, no Internet charge.  (I'd make sure to check that this policy is still in effect, though.  And bring your long Ethernet cord.)\n\nNice place, a mile from the Wright House, and walking distance to Mango's (if it's not 100 degrees out)."
One,"This is THE WORST strip club I have ever been to. I have been to a lot of seedy clubs as well. I've been to clubs where every chick is coked out of her mind to the point where she can't even dance, clubs where chicks are dancing around while the other strippers are watching their babies, even places where girls say they have been raped by club owners. Nothing, and I mean NOTHING is as bad as this club. \n\nThe New York City bouncer out front was a nice guy, and thats where it stopped. The girls here are downright disgusting. These girls don't even look good enough to work the counter at MVD. The place is also crawling with undesirables at all times of the day and night. Their drinks are about $7 for a captain and coke, there were no girls dancing when we were there, the three girls who were working were basically asking if we wanted dances and when I said no, then rolled their eyes and walked away. Well, maybe these girls could dance on stage and THEN ask for a private dance... I want to see what you're made of first.\n\nThe dress code out front, the disgusting women, the attitude from bartenders, and the overall grossness of this place earn it a one star. It would be negative one if it were an option. Hi LIter, Bombshells, and even Cheetah's are a ton better than this place. They are cheaper, have better talent, and are very friendly places. Even the overpriced Bourbon Street would be a better bet than this."
Two,"Chicken Tikka Meh-Sala\r\n-------------------------\r\nHey! An Indian restaurant in central Phoenix! How about that? Awesome, right?\r\n\r\nUm. Don't get too excited, O.\r\n\r\nI get seated in a booth by the front door and survey the scene. Groups and dates of people eating. Flat screen panel showing a sequence of 2006's most craptastic Bollywood videos. Bar stocked with Johnny Walker Black Label, because if you're Indian, that's what you drink. Mango lassi is for wusses.\r\n\r\nI order ground chicken samosas, boneless chicken kebabs, and lamb vindaloo with rice, naan, and raita. Complementary papadum and chutney is placed on my table. Soon after 4 dinky samosas arrive on a small plate. They were ok. Meh is more like it.\r\n\r\nThen I wait a LONG time (20+ minutes) for my entrees. I know grilling chicken takes a while, but these were small boneless pieces - I know it's not supposed to take longer than 4 music videos of Indian hero boy and Indian heroine girl disco dancing in the forest and then all of a sudden a rainstorm and her sari is wet....\r\n\r\n....where was I? Oh yeah. People who came in and ordered 10-15 mintes after I did received their food within 8-10 minutes. That kind of annoyed me. I seethed a little, but only to myself, because I'm suave like that.\r\n\r\nEventually my dinner shows up. Chicken pieces in a sizzling platter. Vindaloo served in an antique metal bowl. Good on the presentation, I'll give them that.\r\n\r\nThe naan was crisp, which is a good plus, because the divine whomevers ruling the universe will strike upon those, the evil misguided purveyors of the Earth's soggy, limp naans. Oh, they will be struck down, mark my words. \r\n\r\nThe chicken, for it taking so long, was very tender and juicy but really mediocre tasting. Mediocre to the point where I recognized the jarred tandoori sauce they marinated the chicken in. So not good to do, my Indian restaurantering friends. \r\n\r\nThe vindaloo was alright...but with really small cubes of lamb and potatoes. I asked for them to make all of my food really spicy, because, well, I'm brown like they are and that's how we roll. But they took it as to make it as bland as possible. Maybe they thought I was an 87-year old English man named Alistair for whom even a sprinkle of crushed black pepper would set his mouth on fire. Who knows.\r\n\r\nWhat I do know is that I was disappointed something huge. An Indian restaurant so close to where I live, and yet so debatable whether if I'm ever going to go back.\r\n\r\nSo two stars (maybe a little greater than two, like two-and-a-third) for the Indian food and Indian service equivalent of  beige. Decent ambiance and friendly host-owner, though, so hey, if you're in the 'hood and are hankering for some curried meh, you've got your ideal place right here. You can thank me later by performing your own Bollywood video."
Three,This is the first time I ever went to Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville.  What can I say?  How about I spell it? T-A-C-K-Y!!!!!  The place just oozed with ... I don't know how to put it.  Remember when you first saw the Alien in Alien and it was all slimy.  That's how I felt walking in.  I felt dirty and weird.  The food however was tasty.  I enjoyed the Jambalaya.  The bathrooms were clean.  My feet never stuck to the bathroom floor which is a plus in my book.  I'll have to see if they have take out because I can't go back.
One,"If you want a professional looking document printed, DONT GO HERE. Quality service is terrible. Screw up an order once, shame on you, screw it up twice, shame on me...I don't know what you say after a third time. I will never come back here again. \n\nThis last time I was very specific with what I wanted. I asked for a full bleed. I set to normal parameters then made sure Rey understood and left. Four hours late when I came back my project looked terrible. When I said it wasn't acceptable, they said it was my fault. They knew what I wanted and when they saw a problem, instead of calling, they just ran it anyway. Then the girl helping me walked around continuing to mutter under her breath. \n\nGreat people you've got working for you OfficeMax!"
Four,"Peanut Butter and Jelly is such a comfort food for me - I grew up on these things. Though I gotta say P.B. Loco's are likely a little better than what Jif and white bread used to make.\n\nI found this place by accident just wandering around Fashion Square mall, and what a find! They have several breads, peanut butters, and jellys to choose from, and a dozen wacky creations of their own. For example a BLT-PB - Wow! However they should add mac-n-cheese to the menu.\n\nhttp://www.pbloco.com"
One,"Been there a couple of times. Would not recommend it.\nWent there first for lunch with a group. Buffet was not great. Actually below average. Customer service WORST! They couldnt split the check equally among people who had given credit cards and cash. They took all the cash and split the rest on credit.\nBAD!!!\nThe next time, it was dinner. Not that great of a food esp for the price. The vegetable fritters tasted like they were fried for the second time. Tasted burnt too!\nNOT going there again."
One,"It's Sunday, right?\n\nDo I have your attention?  It's Sunday, and Barry's Capezio is closed, right?  You need dance supplies for yours or your daughter's dancing class tomorrow and the dance store that you always go to is closed.   You're looking for an alternative and you found this place.  Please don't be tempted.\n\nWhen we went, service seemed friendly, but the consequences for our choice came later.  Our daughter was about ready to begin classes for pointe, and we described to them our situation.  We, on their advice, walked out with demi-pointe shoes--this was the WRONG ADVICE!  No fitting (other than to try them on), no advice as to care, just hand us the shoes and ring us up.  Nothing else.  To see the pain on my daughter's face after that first class was agonizing, as were the huge blisters all over her feet.\n\nWait.  Please wait until Monday."
One,"Its amazing how people are led to believe that this place serves delicious Mexican food. I would like to know WHAT they are ordering. Been there once and never went back again thanks to their awful long lingering wait staff that took forever to bring us drinks and food along with the low quality of the food. The chicken enchiladas I ordered were disgusting to say the least, chicken was black and gross, and they were covered in a mountain of what seemmed to be green ooze that was trying to be salsa verde with nacho cheese. Never been back."
Five,"We have been to Chelsea's a few times for lunch and have not been disappointed.  The Howie Burger and the Santa Fe burger were excellent...not a cheap burger but they are super tasty( Fries were awesome also)\n\nThe last time we went, we ordered just the Chicken Nachos and the Tuna Tartar....that was too much food for both of us.\n\nWe really liked the decor and are hoping to go again when the weather gets a little cool.  Tha patio looks like a nice place to hang out...\n\nHaven't had a bad service experience. It was pretty busy each time we went..."
Four,"Tasty Asian cuisine, in the middle of no where? Yes!\n\nI frequent the tiny village of Youngtown, and to my dismay I can never find a good place for lunch. That's all changed now. T & J is a quiet, unassuming little restaurant with tons of options. I found the quiet, pentatonic music awkward, but it seemed to fade as I browsed through their menu with excitement.\n\nBefore they even hand it to you, there's pictures on the wall of every dish. So, so many options. Roast duck? Chicken prepared in every way imaginable? And just look at those prices! So I ordered some honey chicken for lunch (so much food for so cheap) and it was of decent quality. It came with a crab wonton and an egg roll.\n\nThe reason I'm bumping this place up to four stars is because it has a small bar in the back. Most places like this only serve Tsingtao and maybe some cheap wine. They had some tasty liquors, and even a small specialty drink menu. Including a saketini. Those are my weakness! Time to knock back a few in dullsville."
Four,"I'm a sucker for sweet potato fries!  Any place serving this yummy delicious ingredient deserves my love.  I think I can survive off this for 30 days....any reality TV show takers...huh..huh?  Well, over food was really excellent.  Gourmet burgers are to die for aren't they!?  Sorry Carl's Jr...your $6 burger -- really?  I had the number 3 here - yeah sounds like a secret Chinese sauce, but better!  My burger was cooked just right - juicy and medium-well.  The service was good and the atmosphere tries to re-enact modern hip fine dining.  Though you probably wouldn't know the difference after a few bottles here :) - enjoy!"
Four,"The sandbar is a pretty nice bar, overall.  It's huge, with great music and good people!  I went here for my birthday and had a blast.  The location is kind of weird; it's in a shopping center.  Being from CA, I'm not used to this!  The ONE thing is, don't rub up against the wall of the dance floor...  it cut my back and I was bleeding for 4 days!  But maybe that was more alcohol induced than anything else.   I agree with  the other reviews: don't wear heels - there is actual sand here people! I would totally recommend this place to anyone looking for some good dancing and atmosphere!"
Three,"Who would ever guess that Beaver Choice was a Scandinavian restaurant? And across the parking lot from Ted's Hot Dogs? The convoluted naming history apparently originated from the Mascot of a University they originally were sited near in Canada. But beavers and hot dogs and Massage in the same center?\n\nThe food is unusually wonderful and  . . . unusual. The family cooks and servers are over the top friendly offering samples and telling you about all of their offerings. \n\nThe atmosphere is uncomfortably stark, sterile, and small (less than 400 ft2). Their obvious target customer is take-it-out since they offer a 10% discount if you take-it-out. It is not a restaurant you go to to relax, sit back, and enjoy. It is so small we watched as the cook dipped his ladle into the pot, then tasted the contents, tapped the ladle on the side of the pot, added something else, tasted, tapped, and added several more times before going to another pot and repeating the process - yikes! Do yourself a favor, take the seat facing the window."
Two,"I've been going here for quite a while, somehow I think this place is going down hill quick.\n\nSalad bar as always was kind of odd looking.  As always it was somewhere between mediocre and average. \n\nI had the sausage plate.  Sausage good, potatoes good, red cabbage good.\n\nWife had jager schnitzel (or however it's spelled).  Schnitzel was as tough as leather.  Sauce and mushrooms were good however.  Spatzel...well it was spatzel.\n\nWe ordered desert...apple strudel.  Bleh!  In the past it was pretty good.  This time almost on the edge of not worth eating.\n\nA couple of other points...\n\n- Some one mentioned the ratty ceiling tile.  It's still there\n\n- I've noticed it before and just thought it was a one off thing...but for some reason they like to leave a vacuum cleaner in the dining room\n\n- There's like two german restaurants on the east side of the valley...and they're both in the same parking lot.  How did that happen?\n\nTo be sure this place is in decline, maybe I need to go across the parking lot next time."
Four,"We love Babbo's.  We've been going since they've opened.  We usually get a salad, bread, and an entree to share.  We get out under $20 most times (depending on the entree).  This place is cheaper and way better than Olive Garden.  Service has always been excellent.  Out of the 100 times we've been there only had a problem once and they handled it very professionally-and it was no big deal.  If you want average Italian fare at a good price with nice people this is your place.  They do take out too which is nice when you are too tired to eat in.  They also have a nice patio to dine on when weather permits."
Three,"although i gave 3 stars i would go back.  tea lite is close to me so an easy choice to start my pho adventure.  liked the combo that included pho, egg rolls and a spring roll.  nice variety and just the right portion.  i always get pho with seafood but they don't offer it so i was bummed about that.  ordered the beef and liked the taste plus it wasn't salty like some places i've tried.  the combo was about $7 so very reasonably priced."
Five,"I have been a pt of Dr. Mikel for several years just for my annual care. I just had my 1st baby and can not express how wonderful Dr. Mikel and his staff are. I had a difficult pregnancy, especially during the last 2 months. I was seen 2x a week and Dr. Mikel explained my work situation with his staff. They always got me in on my lunch break, even if they were already booked. Everyone was so compassionate and caring. His medical assistants where there to help comfort me when procedures where done, when my husband could not be there. Dr. Mikel always told me what was going on and did everything he could to ensure a healthy baby for my husband and myself. The hospital care and after care I received from Dr. Mikel was extraordinary. He came everyday I was in the hospital, even though it was his weekend off. I will continue to see Dr. Mikel in the future."
Four,"i don't have to say a whole lot about this place, because everyone else already did. the people are friendly. the food is great. \n\nthe only think i would advise -- make sure you know when they're open.\n\nsunday through tuesday - closed\nwednesday through friday - 11 a.m. to 7:30 p.m.\nsaturday - 2:30 - 7:30 p.m.\n\ni only point this out because it took three times of driving up to a darkened restaurant before we finally got to eat here. however, it's worth the wait. enjoy."
Four,"So I am beginnin to think that there is something better about restaurants in Phoenix.  Yeah, I'm a Scottsdale girl, I admit it, but I  tend to think Scottsdale is a pretty beige place a lot of the time.  Not a lot of character see?  And that is what some restaurants in Phoenix have  - character.  And I think that is one of the things I like about Cibo.  First off, it is in this weird little neighborhood in downtown Phoenix and a little hard to get to if you don't figure out the one way street thing and wind up going down a street the wrong way.  Not too good an idea.  Then there is the fact that ya kinda wonder if your car will be up on blocks when you come out because of the neighborhood.  But Cibo is in a little 1920s bungalow and absolutely charming.  Another great date place!  Shrubs with those little white Xmas lights in them all around the old brick patio, cool old trees outside and the inside is pretty vintage-y too (I made that word up).. I have never eaten inside as the weather has been so darn great everytime I have been there that the patio is where I have wound up.  Anyhoo, on to the food- I think it is great.  I was suggested that I have their white pizza and add red sauce and it was amazing.  Lotsa cheese, gooey, and you could tell that the crust was made there, not prepacked and frozen or something like that. Seriously, that is the only kind I have had there so far and I have been there about 4 x.  Pretty sad...I should try other stuff but once I find something good... 'nuf said.  Their salad with fresh figs was great too.  Add a glass (ok, a bottle) of red wine and you are set.  Oh, and I think that it is the owner who hangs by the door outside and helps with the seating, which btw I think is a great touch.  Whenever an owner cares enough to be there and watch out for the place and assist, I think that is always a good sign.  Obviously the kitchen is doing good without her being back there! :)\n\n\nOnly one thing that I wish they would change/add:  different desserts?  I like Nutella but in everything?  There has gotta be something else you can do?  Buy?  Import? Just a thought....\n\nI just wish that they would move that little house up north so that I can actually enjoy the evening without worrying about the looonggg drive back to Scottsdale..but I guess that is my problem!"
Five,"""After wandering into Liberty Market on a Saturday while looking for a place to have brunch, I decided I may never leave.  Then I came back for lunch a week later, and decided to never leave again.  Having frequented Liberty Market now probably, ohhh...10+ times - always on weekends and always for breakfast/lunch, I'm dubbing it my go-to weekend meal.  I'm not normally a breakfast person, but this place has changed my mind many times over, especially when it comes to flavor, plus they've got something for everyone.  \n\nThere is almost always a constant line that can easily be 15-30 people deep at any given time, but it moves steadily and you never really feel like you're waiting and there's always a seat ready for you by the time you order.  Depending on when you walk in, menus are available for breakfast, lunch or dinner (or both breakfast and lunch if you come in on the weekend between 10am and 1pm) and you can peruse the menu at your leisure while you wait to shuffle up to the register to order.  As you amble through the line, you snake along a tall cooler full of beverages from cans of limonata and bottles of exotic juices and sodas to cans and bottles of craft beer (including some local).  Further along the line you'll pass the pizza making station, where you can watch the cooks toss dough and unique toppings around before gently thrusting a fresh-made pizza into the brick oven (you could even watch it bake if you aren't in a rush...or hungry).  Right after the pizzas, the sides/appetizers and desserts taunt you from a cooler covered with glass that seems to sparkle thanks to all the delicious treats inside.  Just before you can take a look, someone will come up to you and give you a number while pointing out your table for you.  Then you can admire the caprese pasta salad, roasted sweet potato salad, corn-tomato-and-bean salad, hummus, fresh fruit and vegetables of the day, zebra brownies, carrot cake, bread pudding, red velvet cake, ice cream cookie sandwiches, and a cupcake of the day.  When you finally get to the register to order, food is the first thing on your mind and you can't wait to try everything.\n\nAlso, if you're looking for some caffeine...order the cortadito.  Just do it.\n\nI could go on and on, but basically, the food is delicious and the wait times are manageable (the food arrives within 10-15 minutes after you sit down, if that).  It's not too fancy and it's definitely not plain, and yet it still avoids being pretentious while staying in the \just right\"""" zone.  I'm not sure if that makes sense, but it's accurate.  \n\nQuick tip: they do not have a mist system outside, so they don't normally sit people on the patio in the summer, but it's well-shaded, so if you have a dog with you or just want to be away from everyone inside, they will sit you out there, you just have to ask."""""""
Five,"After a year in the Valley, one of my girlfriends took me to Side Bar.  I really like the atmosphere.  It was sleek yet cozy. The night we went in, it was hopping but not overly crowded.  A welcome sight considering much of my first year in the Valley was spent in crowded, pretentious Scottsdale hotspots. \n\nAs I get older, I crave more intimate setting and SideBar fits the bill.  Also, I give five stars to any business who goes out of their way to help a good cause.  SideBar is just that kind of establishment.  If anyone is on Twitter, follow #buzzcation.  @SideBarphx has let #buzzcation folks hold a number of networking and fundraising happy hours.  It's a cool crew so come out and joing and I commend SideBar for always accomodating this crazy crew of tweeples. :)"
Four,"I've been to Fresh Mint several times over the past years and always have a great meal. Having changed jobs, I find myself in that part of town less, but revisited last week with a vegetarian friend and a girlfriend who dabbles. I, on the other hand, enjoy being an omnivore, but regardless of culinary position, this place is just plain great. I'm amazed at how flavorful the sauces are and the menu is fairly diverse with great choices. It's run by a husband/wife team who do the serving and cooking, so you're basically eating their home-cooked meals. I've heard it is also a Kosher certified restaurant, so you know you're getting quality food."
Four,"""I have to say I am a little picky when it comes to fast food burger places.  My husband had been to Five Guys many times and kept asking me to try it.  I finally agreed and was not disappointed.   They burgers are great.  Lean , fresh, meat, not frozen and most importantly NOT SALTY!!   Most burger places rain salt on their burgers, not so at Five Guys.   In fact I even asked for my burger \not seasoned\"""" and the cashier explained they do not season their burgers.  You can get as much of any topping for no extra charge.   Customize it any way you like.   The orders always come out accurate.   Fries are great and always come out hot and fresh.   I have been here several times and will continue to go back.   Give them a try."""""""
Four,"""This is always on my list of spots to visit when I'm in Arizona.  Their bruschettas are amazing and their cheese plates are thoughtfully coordinated and tasty.\n\nAlso, they have great deals on Wednesdays if you become a fan of them on Facebook.\n\nThe waitstaff is helpful and knowledgeable - they know exactly how often to check in, and how to talk to you about things you might want to try without venturing into \PUSHY\"""" territory.\n\nExpect a wait anytime after 5, and all weekend long.  It's never a problem for me, though.  Just imagining that board filled with perfectly topped bruschettas, waiting for me to devour makes the 20-40 minutes infinitely more reasonable..."""""""
Five,"""Ok, right off the bat I'll concede the steaks are quite as good as Mastro's (Ocean Club or City Hall) but they're damn close, and combined with the rest of the menu and the service its a better overall experience.  \nThe food is GREAT, especially the shrimp with cream sauce (I forget the exact name, but its featured on the menu).  The steaks are well marbled, not overly seasoned and perfectly cooked, and my wife says the fish is terrific as well.  The bar pours real drinks and the waitstaff knows how to serve them.  \nMy biggest problem with many of the best steak places in town is the vibe they give off that \you're just lucky to be here\"""".  Not so at OP, rather it feels like they've been waiting for your party to arrive all night, which sounds cheesy I know.  Definitely a favorite."""""""
Four,"""I've never provided a review ever but felt compelled to do so after reading some of the comments.  So here goes my review debut.  \n\nI've been waiting for a pho shop to open close to the Biltmore (24th St. & Camelback) which is where my office and home are located.  I'm Vietnamese and all I really care about when it comes to pho is the quality of the broth and freshness of the ingredients:  Pho House delivers on that product pho sure!!  And nothing beats a bowl of pho for less than $6 (sorry, for folks who complain that $6 is expensive probably need to stick with Taco Bell).  I've only been there a handful of times since learning of their opening through a mail advertisement, so I'm not too familiar with the owners or employees (as I am with the folks at Da Vang and Pho Thanh).  The owners/staff are seemingly more quiet and not as \outgoing\"""" as the other places but they have always been responsive to my table needs and the needs of customers when I've been there.  Also, I'm not sure the standard to which folks measure cleanliness but Pho House is no different than most other local places my family have dined at including DV's and PT.  And yes, it is very common for Vietnamese restaurants to be closed on Tuesday (certain small family-owned businesses need a day off too, just happens not to be Sundays like most); certainly nothing to be critical of.  \n\nI definitely recommend Pho House for a delicious hot bowl of tasty soup."""""""
Four,"""It's been nearly a year since my last Update of Pacific here, so I stopped in for the Lunch Buffet today, joined by Scott W. & Norm R.  My report this time is just about identical to the last one.  Here we have the largest Buffet in Arizona (along with it's twin in Chandler), featuring 162 main food items.  There's a BIG Sushi \boat\"""", lots & lots of tasty meat & seafood dishes of all different kinds, excellent Mongolian BBQ, & so on; an awesome array of food!\n\nThe only thing bringing this one down to 4 Stars rather than the 5 the Chandler location earns is the same small management slips as reported before...  not all of the food out until well after opening time, & again, that half-frozen Strawberry Cake that should be served at room temperature!  It's a shame they don't run a tighter ship here, because this place really is special overall, & our table service from \""""Carla\"""" was just right.\n\nIt's a HIGH 4 STARS for this excellent, \""""Almost as good as it gets\"""" Buffet where it's FUN to eat!     :-))\n\nWeekday Lunch Buffet still $9.38/$8.45 Sr."""""""
Five,"We went to Roy's for my birthday on Sunday, May 1st.  I made a reservation online and the online form asked if there was a special occasion, so I entered that it was my birthday and it asked for my name... when we got to the restaurant they had personalized the menu's with a welcome and happy birthday page which was beautiful and a really nice surprise.  Each of us (me, my husband and two teenagers) had something different and everything was delicious.  They also brought a complimentary birthday dessert as well as took a group photo and delivered it to us in a frame.  The birthday desserts as well as the chocolate lava cake and the pineapple upside down cake were a perfect way to complete a wonderful evening.  I really would recommend Roy's for any special occasion."
Five,"I called about 2 weeks before our 1 year anniversary, regarding the top tier of our cake. Kevin said no problem & that we could pick it up Saturday, our anniversary was on Sunday & they're closed. We couldn't decide which flavor to chose so I told him to pick it for us. I also asked if it could just be covered in buttercream instead of fondant.\n\nThe top tier looked so cute! They chose the white cake infused with almond flavor with almond cream cheese & strawberry fillings & it was AMAZING! The random dots of fondant were a nice touch & the cake was so moist & delicious. Can't wait to get our 5th anniversary top tier!"
Four,"Go for happy hour to this place and get some great deals.\nDrinks:  I have to mention this cause I am no drinker, but I had one of the best Margharitas in my life here.\nBeing the cheap-o I am, any drink on their happy hour menu is $5, so I found the most expensive one that appealed to me ($8.50 normally) made with agave juice and plata tequila and some other things.  It was great.  So great I think I told the bartender what a great drink it was.  Yeah, it was great.\nThen for $5 at happy hour I ordered a pepperoni pizza--figuring it would be some frozen crappy hard pizza.  But no it wasn't!  Quelle suprise!  It was a fresh baked pizza dough with real cheese and real basil on top.\nSo worth the money!\nThis place has a great happy hour!!!  I will be back with friends again.\nI mean, where can you get a great meal for $10?  Good service, too."
Five,"""Phoenix just got a lot more livable.\n\nMy standards for movies rental places have always been Vidiots in Santa Monica or Old Bank DVD in downtown LA, but this place has etched a new spot on that list. Since moving back to Phoenix, I tend to get movies from the Burton Barr branch of the Phoenix Public Library downtown. I know it's a public library, but it actually has an awesome and extensive collection of foreign films and just about a every title from the Criterion Collection you can feast your cineaste eyeballs on. \n\nAnyway, I was browsing the foreign section and was pretty impressed. It wasn't the usual, pitiful selection most rental places usually have that pretty much is made up of The Seventh Seal, Seven Samurai, maybe a French title, and an overload of pre-Loaded Weapon 4 Jet Li martial arts films. No, sir. While it's not as big as the stock at the downtown library, it's still pretty good and they have alot of recent films.\n\nWhat sold me was when I was wandering around the store. I came across something that I normally haven't found in any video store: Russ Meyer films. If you have never seen \Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!\"""", I suggest you scrap any plans you have tonight, break up with your significant other if necessary, go here, and rent it immediately. Buying a copy of a Russ Meyer films is ludicrous process that is both arduous and expensive, but you can just go in here and rent them.\n\nAlong with that, you can find just about any cult film you're looking for and probably find titles you've never heard of or seen, like I did. There's literally a whole wall that's just labeled \""""CULT FILMS\"""". I dropped in here last night for the first time and rented a copy of Russ Meyer's \""""Vixen\"""" and a title that I had seen in Amoeba but never watched called \""""A Boy and His Dog\"""". It's a film about Don Johnson (yes, of Miami Vice) surviving in a post-apocalyptic world with his telepathic dog and fighting off a cult of underground humans led by Jason Robards in clown, drag make-up. Need I say more?\n\nIf you're looking for a hard-to-find title, or even a popular one, drop in here and keep this place alive. When you have an itch for a film right away that can't wait for Netflix, as I do on regular occasions, this spot will be sure to please.\n\nIf you have any taste in film, I repeat.... GO HERE TO FIND WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR!"""""""
Five,"My wife and I went here on a whim after hearing about them from the car wash next door. The place was incredibly quiet...one person at the bar, no one in the dining room. We were promptly seated, and looked over the menu, settling on satay and littleneck clams to start with, then the mussaman and curry for entrees. The littleneck clams were very tasty, and the broth lively and sweet. The chicken for the satay was moist and tender, perfectly seasoned with a peanut sauce with a surprisingly light texture. I ordered my mussamon hot, but not Thai hot, and the spice gave me a workout. We finished it off with a mango mousse cake that had my wife and I fighting for the last bite. Nettie's service was friendly and warm, and definitely gave us a good reason to go back."
Five,"""My boyfriend and I stayed here for Spring Training in Peoria, AZ. It's about a thirty minute drive from Peoria but I chose to stay here because of the reviews on Yelp and I wanted to stay in a boutique hotel. We were so pleased with our decision to stay at the Hotel Valley Ho.\nRight off the bat, we knew it was going to be a pleasant stay because making the reservation w/ Molly was so easy and painless. I was not on hold for too long, I wasn't transferred around, and she was personable and friendly. When we pulled up to the hotel, the first thing I thought was \wow, these grounds are huge!\"""" The hotel itself is nicely wide spread but not too much where it's a pain to walk around. It's got a nice park feel to the outside of it so it's more of pleasant stroll to your room, from Caf\u00e9 Zuzu or the parking lot or the lobby.\nWe stayed in the King Studio with the stand along tub, and OMG, I LOVE that room! I want a tub like that in my home one day! It was clean, the colors were nicely coordinated, and the room itself was pretty warm and comfortable. The only downer about the room I would have to say is the bed. I'm not sure if it was the excitement for Spring training or if we just missed our bed at home (we have been traveling for about four days at this point), but my boyfriend and I did not get the best night's sleep that night. This really was not too bad because we got up at 6am and worked out in the gorgeous gym they had. It overlooks the pool and we watched the sun rise as we ran on the treadmills. The gym was clean; they offered sanitized head phones (so convenient, I think) and there were towels on every cardio machine. Also, the lemon water was a nice touch as well.\nWe did not get a chance to visit the spa but we did peruse spa store and I scored the cutest salmon colored bikini for $10.00 (originally $115.00) so definitely stop in and check out the sale rack at the Spa!\nOverall, I cannot wait to come back. We'll be staying here again for next year's spring training! Thank you Hotel Valley Ho!"""""""
Five,"Found this place on yelp - thank you Yelp!\n\nIt is not a place I would go to without the recommendation of others, but yum! I recommend the street tacos! $1.75 each and filling 4 is enough for a man two was more than enough for me! Pollo and pastor for meat (everything is in Spanish so ask questions if you like to know what you are eating. I got a mini quesadilla too but it paled in comparison to the tacos, will eat there again! Super friendly staff, I live supporting small kick butt businesses!"
Five,"So, a carnivore goes into veggie restaurant...\n\nNo, seriously, this is great stuff. I have a friend who's a veggie and loves Indian food, so when I noticed this place sandwiched between a hair salon and a pizza chain, I had to tell her. We checked it out tonight, and DAMN. The Gobi Manchurian is amazing, especially with the mint chutney. The spinach dosai is very good, but a bit dry (not that that stopped us from fork-fighting over the last bits). This unrepentant flesh-eater went away completely happy and didn't miss the meat at all. Think I'll be coming back at least once a week."
Four,"""Lord Have Mercy!\n\nI finally stopped in after my stomach was grumbling this evening. I'm no stranger to BBQ nor soul food, so I was ready to go once I walked in to this joint. \nThe menu offerings are displayed upon a chalkboard behind the counter. It consisted of your typical smoked meats, sides, desserts and beverage offerings. \n\nThey offer their meats in either 1/2 lb. or Full Pound. Their sides are offered in 8 oz sizes, with some sides such as Potato salad, coming in either smaller or larger sizes. \n\nI bellied up to the counter and went for Gusto. I ordered 1/2 lb. beef brisket, 8 oz Mac & Cheese, Peach Cobbler and a Sweet Iced Tea. \n\nThe pleasant lady behind the counter had her hands full with counter orders as well as the telephone ringing of the hook for takeout orders. \nShe politely asked me to have a seat and she'd bring my drink out to me. \nThe sweet tea was definitely sweet. Just like Gran used to make. \n\n15 minutes later I was graced with the order of brisket, smothered in a sweet, slightly tangy BBQ sauce, and my side of Mac & Cheese. Both were piping hot. When the gentleman brought it out, he asked if I wanted my cobbler hot or cold. A nice touch. \nI ate my supper, and cleaned my plate. They brought out my dessert after I was done. The only reason I took a star off was because I was a little unimpressed with the Cobbler. The flavor was there, but it was a bit \wet\"""". There was a  very thin sugary syrup that was on the first 1/2 inch of the bowl of cobbler. But once I dug in, it was gone, wet or not. \n\nI did like the fact that even though this is a place where you order at the counter, there was still some dining room presence. A young lady came around in between orders and asked if we needed anything, and offered me a refill on my Iced Tea. \n\nThis place will definitely see my ugly face again. It's a solid, neighborhood BBQ joint that has a decent selection, and the prices are very fair. \nDon't forget, CASH ONLY!!"""""""
Three,"I don't recommend coming here for the food, especially if you're vegetarian, but it is a nice place to enjoy a beer and hang out in a fun western environment. The food menu is kind of expensive for what it is. The beer, on the other hand, is awesome. They have a brewing company, Sonoran Brewery, and it's really great. The White Chocolate Ale is really something else! I think Pinnacle Peak is one of the few (or only) places you can find it on tap. \n\nI recommend coming here after hiking the Peak or in the afternoon/evening to enjoy a beer and their lovely patio. On Sunday evenings there is a country band that is quite good."
Four,"Never a disappointing experience here! I've been frequenting this local joint, primarily for breakfast, the entire 3 years I've lived here in the Tempe / Phoenix area. I love introducing friends to Harlow's as well because inevitably they become hooked too.\n\nThere are a couple downsides to this place, if you even wanna call them that: 1) limited parking can make it very frustrating to find a spot and 2) the prices are a little bit higher than what you'll pay at places like Denny's, Ihop or 5 and Diner. But those places suck anyway, so it's totally worth paying a little more for better food and better ambiance.\n\nSome favorites are the blueberry pancakes and the biscuits and gravy. The thick cut bacon is delicious too!\n\nWent here today for breakfast and I just might have to go again tomorrow!"
One,"I came to party city looking for supplies for a jungle themed birthday party for a little boy.  I didn't find much in stock that suited my needs.  There were a lot of luau themed party supplies.  I did manage to find a few things that would work for my party, but upon interacting with the staff, I decided against purchasing any of the items I had gathered.  One young man was helpful in a perfunctory way, but the young woman who seemed to be in charge was so rude that I voted with my feet and walked out without spending any money."
Four,"PV mall is just what you would expect from a mall, except it does have a added bonus: an indoor carousel and a nicely lite children's play area. For those two things, it's worth the extra drive from your run of the mill mall near you. \nIf you want to take your little one to the play area, park in front of the Starbucks and it's just down the way. If you want the carousel only, park near the food court. Carousel rides are just $1, cash only for that though. You have to insert your money into a machine for a token. Hope that helps!"
Four,"""As I walked into Delux the other night I instantly felt guilty of cheating on my beloved burger joint, that shall remain nameless in this review..... \n\nI have to say I was impressed.

Next time if I am feeling feisty I will trying them out. \n\nI ordered the Turkey Burger, very good. It has lots of flavor. And sadly I had to admit that their wheat bun is a bit better than the one I get at the burger place that shall remain nameless. \n\nOver all the place is a go. Nice ambiance, a tv to watch the game, great plate presentation, good sized patio out front (patio is key in AZ!). One thing I will say negatively.... bar stools - not comfortable at all."""""""
Four,"""What a difference a guided tour and 24 hours can make!\n\nUpon learning of my less-than-stellar reaction to their favorite sushi and teppan spot, the insisted I return.

I nibbled on a little of the white toro and even had some of the teppan others were enjoying. Outstanding!\n\nSo if you go, ignore the rolls. It's as if they are made for the average schmo who doesn't really like sushi and was brought there on a dare. In fact, skip the whole menu and look behind the sushi bar to the little white board. That's the good stuff."""""""
Five,"I love this place. So much.\n\nEver since Texano's in Tempe closed, Fiesta Burrito has been my go-to place for adobada burritos. A side of sour cream is a necessity with the adobada burrito and they give you a good portion for the price. I also like lots of pico and they have a big container of it inside at the salsa bar.\n\nThe machaca plate with egg (#11) is my second favorite. I always use the accompanying tortilla to make my own burrito, plus I get the rice and beans on the side. Yum.\n\nThe quesadilla supreme is also very good, but I would recommend eating it with a fork and knife, they really load it up.\n\nOverall, I have never had anything bad from Fiesta and the staff is always super friendly. Plus there's a drive-thru. Awesome!"
Two,I had a coupon for $17.99 so decided it was worth a try!  I was told there was 1 car in front of me.  I said that i was on lunch for an hour and he said no problem   So I sat and waited.  And waited.  40 min later they still hadnt taken my car in.  The man behind the desk was on the phone for the last 20 min do I couldn't ask.  Finally someone else walks behind the desk and he hangs up the phone.  And then e gets up and gives my keys to a serviceman. So I ha r been sitting here for 40 min and you didnt even give my keys in?  It's now been over an hour and my car is still up on the lift. I can see them actually working on it now.  Took a little over an hour.  I paid by money and walked outside to get the car.  I had to ask if everything was ok with the car - usually they come and tell you that you need x & y done to you car.  The guy mumbled its fine and walked away. \n\nWouldn't recommend this place if you want a quick oil change!
Five,"""Best way to pass the time for the infamous wait for Pizzeria Bianco. I had a great time with a friend here. \n\nIt's a cozy place with a historical feel.

Five,"""The boyfriend and I found this place after stopping for milkshakes at the new Rally's built in front of it.  We saw the sign, drove by, and thought, \Well, this place sure doesn't look too busy!\""""  So we made plans to come back and try it for real, as both of us are rather adventurous in general when it comes to food.  We looked up the menu online, so we knew what type of food it was, and an idea of how to proceed.\n\nNo one was there when we arrived except for the waiter, who was, apparently, also the cook.  He had us sit wherever we wanted and took our drink order promptly.  I had the ice tea, and my boyfriend the water.  We perused the menu for a while, still, trying to make up our minds.  We settled on the appetizer beef ribs, crispy chicken \""""gingerroot style\"""" (half portion) and a crispy pork dish with green chiles and onions on a sizzling platter.\n\nThe beef ribs were really tasty!  They were tender and the sauce served with them was quite good.  The chicken was juicy and the sauce served with it added a delightful flavor.  The crispiness of the chicken was just right (not too much breading, and it had a taste of its own).  The pork was really good as well.  It comes with a fried egg on top, and the meat is served \""""crispy\"""" which gives it a somewhat \""""sticky\"""" texture, but it was delicious and full of flavor.  My boyfriend enjoyed putting some of the sauce for the beef ribs on the pork as well.\n\nOverall, the food was delicious.  Our waiter was courteous - neither hovering nor disappearing.  The large television was much preferable to watch than the dreary weather outside.  The ambiance of this little place is adorable and snug.   It may be a little hard to find as it is hidden behind the new buildings (Rally's and the Sweet Shop) but it's worth the effort!  The only suggestion I have is that more people visit here!"""""""
Three,"I have to say that I like the Scottsdale location much more.  The hostess brought us in right away and got us a table where we could watch the game.  The food was just as good as the Scottsdale location and our waitress was very nice but they had no AC!  Its 110 degrees outside!  How can you not have AC inside?!  (If there was AC I would have given them 4 stars.) There are misters going like mad outside but if you're outside you can't watch the game.  Tough choices.\n\nThe Sox/Yankees were on when we went and they were nice enough to put it on the TV that my seat was facing, even taking off the YES broadcast and putting on the ESPN feed when I asked.  Awesome.  \n\nPS.  The parking situation kinda sucks."
Four,"""This Hyatt Place follows along the new updated designs and concept of this newer brand of the Hyatt Family. \n\nThe appeal is to savvy, younger business travelers, to give Hyatt something to compete in business categories against Hilton's, Holiday Inn and Starwood brands. The design is modern, with service minimized to the essentials for well seasoned business travellers, like a small bar, breakfast area, 2 room split suite with euro-type decor with male color tones, self check-in kiosks, and 42 inch Plasma TV with HD programs.\n\nThis one is a good value, as it is located in OldTown Scottsdale, just a couple of blocks from a large choice of trendy bars and restaurants, and not far from the Scottsdale Art district. \n\nMost of the Hyatt Places are located east of the Missisippi, and only 3 or 4 in California so far. Starwood has responded with a newer, similar concept, called their \aLoft\"""" brand, with the same trendy hip loft like concept. \n\nI got a rate of $134, which isn't bad for the beginning of SnowBird season, when rates creap higher in the Valley, especially in Scottsdale."""""""
Five,"Dozo is one of the best Sushi restaurants in AZ. I'm very picky when it comes to fish quality.  This place does not disappoint.  Their yellowtail and salmon is unbelievable.  For something even more unique, try the Escolar Sashimi.  It is a torch seared buttery flavored type of tuna that is served with a great jalapeno soy dressing with some mixed greens on the side.  This is a very unique dish if you like rich flavored sashimi.  \n\nRobert is the owner and the main sushi chef.  You can tell he takes great pride in his work and you can always watch him prepare the sushi dishes at the sushi bar.  If you are not familiar with their specials just ask and they will be glad to make a suggestion for you.  The staff is always friendly and does their best to make sure your experience is enjoyable.  I have brought many clients here on business dinners and all have been impressed.  Even friends from Japan are surprised with the quality of their fish - especially for AZ!!!  They also have great cooked items for the not so adventurous.  I suggest trying the grilled lamb chop, baked scallop or mussels, and the Hamachi Kama for cooked items.\n\nFor those with a sweet tooth, their green tea tiramasu is to die for.  It is made by Robert's wife in-house so is is not always available.  Just ask and if they have it, it is a must try."
Four,"First off I haven't been to the location myself yet, though I did get food there (family brought it home) so can't comment on wait, the staff, decor, all that stuff. \n\nAs for the food, I thought it was good for the price. I had the double Charburger with cheese, which wasn't anything special but that isn't a bad thing. I thought the portion size (burger at least) was good, and everything tasted fresh which is a plus. \n\nFor what it market seems to be, I think it is 4 star quality. It isn't anything that blows me away, but if I find a joint in this type of market that did I would be amazed. I'd say it is about on par with In N Out for me, just different finishing (In N Out has their sauce compared to just the mayo that was on my Double Charburger). \n\nIf you like In N Out, I'd suggest giving Habit a try, I don't think you'll be too disappointed. If you tend to go mostly to BK/McD then you need to go to Habit right away, it will blow those two out of the water (and I love BK now and then)."
Four,"Cornish Pasty Company\n1941 W. Guadalupe Road\nMesa, Arizona\n\nWe arrived on a Friday night at 6:00 as a party of 14. Probably not the most fair thing to do since I knew I was going to review the restaurant, yet it didn't phase them in the least. While they take no reservations, they treated us courteously, and seated us after a short wait.\n\nThis is not the quietest place to eat at, as a lot of it has to do with the bar, which is very conducive to friendly chit chat, but overlooking that, it's quite a charming place. There is seating outside, as well as in church pews inside, which makes for a cozy atmosphere as well as the possibility of having new conversations with people you have never met - something that Americans are not used to, but is very common in the rest of the world.\n\nEveryone ordered soft drinks except for myself. I ordered a Strongbow to see if it was what I remembered from the U.K., and it was no different at all. A true hard cider with good flavor of apples.\n\nFor my main course, I ordered the Oggie, a mixture of steak, potato, onion and rutabaga, served in a pastry crust with a small cruet of red wine gravy. ($8.00) . I was instantly transported back to the U.K. with my first bite. It had great depth of flavor, and the red wine sauce was absolute dynamite. An excellent dish! I also ordered a side of Mushy Peas ($2.75) and a side of Baked Beans ($2.50). The peas had nice flavor and were exactly as served in England, but I didn't care for the Baked Beans. There seemed to be an odd flavor associated with them that was off putting and which everyone agreed was not very tasty. \n\nOther members of our party ordered the Italian, the Porky (pronounced as orgasmic), the Shepherds Pie, the Reuben (good corned beef), the Chicken Greek (said to be very tasty), and the Lamb Vindaloo (usually very spicy, but apparently toned down here for American palates). Two of our party ordered the Pilgrim, which is roasted turkey, sweet potatoes, grilled onions, stuffing and red wine gravy. One pronounced it terrific, while the other didn't care for it.\n\nThe menu also includes a nice assortment of vegetarian dishes as well.\n\nMost people didn't have room for dessert, but a few did, with almost everyone sharing. One of the desserts was Banoffee Pie - a graham cracker crust, homemade caramel, whipped cream and fresh bananas. It was interesting to note that the whipped cream was unsweetened. When mixed with the other ingredients, it picked up it's sweetness from them and tended to tone down the overall sweetness of the dish - a wonderful idea of what would otherwise have been an overly sweet dessert.\n\n\nThe other dessert that was ordered was the Apple Caramel Pasty - a kind of apple turnover pie crammed full of apples and cinnamon and covered with a homemade caramel sauce and served with a large scoop of Vanilla Ice Cream. Nothing could have been better, especially since the caramel wasn't too sweet.\n\nConsidering how crowded the place was, service was not too bad, and certainly could have been a lot worse.\n\nPerhaps the only fault I could find was with the ladies room. The paper bin was full to the top, and the rolls of paper were scattered around instead of being in holders. I have been in nicer restrooms in other restaurants.\n\nOverall, this was a wonderful eating experience, with several authentic dishes on the menu as well as some creative ones. I recommend it highly and give it 4 stars."
Three,"I ate at Tutti Santi while in Phoenix for a business conference.  Met up with a co-workers father-in-law who happened to be in town and he suggested Tutti Santi, which he had visited on previous trips.  Had it not been for that recommendation, I don't know that I ever would have found this place.\n\nThey were quite busy that night due to a special promotion and it seemed that they were not quite used to it.  It took quite some time to place our order.  We ordered a bottle of wine for the table and I ordered a salad and gnocchi.  We started sipping the wine while waiting for our appetizers.  The salad was decent and the bread they brought for the table was actually very good.  However, due to the slow service, our wine bottle was empty long before the food came.\n\nWhen the food arrived, we ordered another bottle of wine and began eating.  The gnocchi was very good, and everyone else seemed to enjoy their order as well. Unfortunately, our second bottle of wine never arrived.  When we mentioned it, the waiter apologized, but that was it.\n\nThis would have been an easy four star review but the sub-par service killed it for me. They may have been busy, but 15 minutes for drinks and 30 minutes for salads is still pushing it."
Four,"For anyone with movie-envy from friends living in LA, SF or NYC who talk about going to cool art house theaters, this is the answer for Phoenix. Unlike Camelview, which is more of a traditional theater, FilmBar is really more of a cool bar that also happens to show movies. You can simply go to grab a drink, but doing so before/during/after one of their flicks is what this place is all about. Forget about some of the big-budget movies that you'll likely regret seeing and check out FilmBar for a unique movie going experience."
Four,"""Update:New Management = New way of life.  this Starbucks has made great improvements.

That's great.\n\n2011 Review\nI'm giving them a 3 because I rarely get exactly what I want from the window. But let me start with the good first.  Friendliest bunch of folks I've ever seen.  All people on the staff seem to love their jobs!  They also seem to work very efficiently.   \n\nUnfortunately, the attire is a little small.  Ites not conducive to a small study group, even though it practically sits on a small college campus..  No couches or comfy chairs to sit and socialize.\n\nMy main reason for the 3 rating is the fact that I rarely get what I \want\"""" from that drive up window!  I used to order a tall coffee and a HOT veggie sandwich.  The sandwich is almost always cold in the center, even if I ask them to heat it longer so the center is warm.  Sometimes I ask for my coffee with two pumps of cream and I have to go in to get more cream.  I have stopped ordering the sandwiches as much, saves me money, that's for sure.  \n\nI started making my own coffee at home, and soon, I'll probably just stop by there as a treat once a week for the coffee, sans the sandwhich."""""""
Five,Can't take a star off for crappy AT&T reception.  I made all my calls in the business office/closet.  \n\nNot a place to wear your Louboutins but if you choose to you can get a lift from your room in a zippy golf cart.  \n\nI had an ultimate manicure in a spa chair that creepily resembles an adult high chair.  Nice selection of OPI and a terrific paraffin wax.  Good massage with my happy ending being white chocolate covered strawberries.  Pedicure poolside.\n\nSeveral very good meals.  Excellent tapas in the bar and yummy white sangria and tequila pi\u00f1a locas.  I preferred Talavera to Crescent Moon but that was based on my fondness for faux Italian over tex mex.\n\nThe car service they arranged was wonderful and much easier than making independent arrangements.    \n\nI'm not one for the desert but with all the bunnies abounding and beautiful surroundings I had a very nice time.
Three,"Food: tasty Experience: ghetto (the bad kind)\n\nMy wife loves the Turkey Burger (TURKEY FAT!) and I, the Boca (BOCA!). I think most people eat burgers for the condiments and Fat Burger is evidence to support -- try a fried egg on yours, mmmm!\n\nTheir shakes are tasty too and my kids won't shut up about them. \n\nHere's the ghetto part:\n\nStuff breaks and they don't fix it; to the point where I think they take pride in how long they can go without having to fix things. We've been going to this location for 3-4 years and the juke box is completely unplayable more often than not (don't get me started on never-once-working jukebox and forever-broken-covered-with-a-traffic-cone-barstool at the Desert Ridge Fat Burger). \n\nI wish they'd bring back the real lemonade, too. Minute Maid is not lemonade."
Five,"Update: Just got back from SanTan last night. You know what? I'm upping my score to five stars. This place totally rocks!\n\nWe pulled about 35 folks through our #evfn event (Search for it here. We're a lot of fun!) The place was jam packed, and I was worried it was going to be a bust. Boy, was I wrong.\n\nThe staff quickly played a life-sized version of Tetris with the table, shuffling folks around to accommodate a group of our size. Everyone was happy -- especially us!\n\nI think we'll make this part of our regular stops!"
Three,"This morning I opened my fridge to a big fat empty space... and that's when I knew - time to go grocery shopping - and not just any grocery shopping - time to load up!\n\nSure - it's fine to go to AJ's here and there, and the Farmers Market (when in season) for fresh produce.  Sunflower and Albertson's aren't far, but for whatever reason, I chose to do my shopping today at Safeway.  \n\nFor $121, I stocked the fridge.  I won't go into the details of my purchases (grocery shopping can get really personal, you know?!) - but I will say that I came home happy.  I also am proud to say that I will be eating in all three of my meals today, and maybe snacks too.  Don't you love when you can do that?  I do!\n\nSafeway - please work on your fresh seafood selection - there was not much there to choose from.  But other than that, I am a big fan!  I'm sure I'll see you again real soon..."
Five,"This is the best place for a great kids meal! Salmon,steak,ribs and 2 sides with it for around $7.95!  My kids loved the variety. My daughter had the ribs, fresh fruit and carrot sticks and dip. My son had the salmon, cooked veggies and mashed potatoes. If you are traveling and want to bring the kids to a nicer place I would recommend Firebirds.\nGreat  steaks, great wine list and half price wine in Tuesday,s  The desserts are HUGE so only order 1 for 3 people. And the carrot cake was amazing."
Two,"""So Garduno's is now Camarones and from what I can tell the only difference is the name. \n\nThe building itself is very nice. Multiple seating areas, a cute patio bar as you enter and even an sun room (where we sat) that looks like you could open the windows and let fresh air in if desired. The menu has the standards on there fajitas, chimis, enchiladas, combination plates, etc. They even have steaks, some seafood options, and the standard hamburger (that all chain Mexican restaurants feel they need to have for our out of town company from the Midwest that is not used to the \spice\""""). The prices are a bit steep for what you end up getting in my opinion. The portion sizes were large, but the flavor was lacking. I shared a \""""fiesta platter\"""" with my mom trying to get a feel for the food and other than the red chili pork burrito, ever thing else was bland. The chicken in the quesadilla was just boiled chicken. I would of liked some chile or onion laced within to try and amp up the flavor but no such luck. The rolled tacos were just as bland and not much different from the kind you find in your freezer selection. Was it the best choice off the menu? Probably not but I was feeling cheep and not incredibly hungry so spending 20 bucks on fajitas didn't sound appealing. I thought my meal would be redeemed by service and sophapillas- but our waiter was just OK and my drink sat empty for a while which bugs me and the sophapillas, while hot, lacked cinnamon, sugar or powder sugar, and despite my generous application of honey where still bland in comparison to other places."""""""
One,"I really don't understand why all the great reviews about this place. Maybe it's because of it's location (being one of the few restaurants in Litchfield Park) or maybe it's the alcohol. Either way, it's not that good. Being new to Arizona, we decided that on our anniversary we would try 2 new restaurants. The Old Pueblo Cafe was our dinner choice. Poor choice to end a great day on this note. We had a trio of tacos (1 beef, 1 chicken & 1 fish) and a green chile beef chimichanga. The chimi was mediocre. The tacos were all bad. The fish taco actually made us sick. All 3 were hard from being old tortillias. Absolutely this has been the second worst Mexican food we have ever eaten. Also, the food is really overpriced for the quality and quantity. We won't be back and recommend that you don't waste your time, money or calories either."
Five,Scottsdale has so many fufu fancy fusion style twisty no look resaturants. It is a breath of fresh  air to get a NEW restaurant that stays true to its classical Mexican roots. \n\nATS hit a homerun not only with the food and service but also the location. The Carne Asada burritos as well as the Pollo Asada are phenomal. I also go XL on the food trust me you won't regret it. The food leaves you full and not bloated like many other Mexican restaurants around Old Town. \n\nThe back patio as a cool ambiance and is a great place to get out of the Old Town scence for a second. The chips and salsa are delicious and they also have a good quesadilla. I would recommend this place when your looking for a good go to Mexican meal.
Four,"Two words for ya! ANIMAL STYLE. The menu here is very simple. It hasn't changed since it opened in the early 1900's. Nothing but burgers, fries and shakes made from the freshest ingredients! My meal of choice: Double Double, Animal Style with fries and a Lemon-Up (or root beer). \n\nThis burger joint is NOT a franchise, it's family owned, so you are getting way better customer service and quality food than you'll find at McD's or BK! There's nothing gourmet about an In-n-Out burger, they are just so damn tasty! Only downside is that they're only on the west coast! Sorry East coast!"
Five,"""Having lived in Phoenix for just shy of 18 months, I'm always on the lookout for places that feel like a \home from home\"""". Venues that, despite being new to the senses, feel like a favourite sweater. One such place is Wy Knot.\nI first stumbled across Wy Knot just at it was changing ownership (used to be Perc Up as mentioned in other reviews) whilst looking for somewhere on 7th St to meet up. Spoke to Jackie, the new owner, who told me of her plans to revamp the menu for a more \""""as much as possible from scratch\"""" feel.\nThe venue itself is situated next to Humble Pie, the decor is homely without being cluttered, and the ambiance is equally relaxing. The staff are friendly and attentive, but not overbaring, and if you get to meet Jackie you'll find her enthusiasm for what she's doing contagious. Damn good coffee too.\nNow for the real reason you must go. The food. The menu is just comprehensive enough with specials added, and the dishes I've tried so far have been right on the money, with just enough attention to the aesthetic without being pretencious; it makes you feel that someone has acknowledged that you also eat with your eyes. One example: the yoghurt, honey and fresh fruit parfait served layered in a sundae glass with 2 wafer-thin slices of apple on top.\nThen there's the pancakes. Oh, boy. the pancakes. I don't know how they make them, or what witchcraftery goes on in the kitchen, but wow. And I've tried a few pancakes in my time! Trust me on this: If you have them and don't think they're the best you've ever tasted, then you're eating wrong and no-one can help you. Just visit the Cafe once and order them. You can send me the Thank You card later.\nI've found a perfect breakfast/brunch/lunch spot, and Wy Knot have found a regular patron."""""""
Four,"""I first went to the Mesa location but had to try the original one.  I was surprised to see that both places are very slim and long.  This location is very small.  How small you ask?  Small enough that the staff constantly has to stop what they are doing to step aside and let other coworkers pass.  They were good at it though.\n\nI love trying different types of food, and if it's a small local I am definitely in.  After checking out the rave reviews I gave them a shot.  I loved my pasty (Pass-tee) at both locations but I was denied the shepards pie one in Mesa because they were out.  I lucked out and finally got it at this location.  Boy was that good.  Ground lamb just has a better flavor note to it that beef doesn't bring to the table.\n\nWe also had a little half salad and some roasted potatoes.  Both were tasty and the roasted potatoes have a coat of fresh thyme on them and didn't have the fat and grease factor of fries.\n\nIn a place this small it is impossible to have bad service.  You can literally reach out and tap the staff if you feel neglected, that is how close they are.  Why do they get minus a star?  Because I am 6'5\ and had to assume a yoga pose that I am neither familiar with, nor comfortable performing due to the closeness of the stool to the bar.  I could have chosen a table, but I live to drink in the experience.  \n\nThey have several beers to choose from, bonus points for not having American piss water on tap and having a little variety.  The place is very casual with some personality too.  \n\nA little tip for those like me who broke the record for most U-turns within a 100 yards.  The place faces west on the NE side of the intersection between University and Hardy.  A little tricky at night because the sign may not be on and the little shopping center address isn't lit up either.  \n\nGreat food, friendly and social staff.  Unique little place.  What more do you want?"""""""
Five,"so we were from LA and somehow suddenly found the appetite for some good BBQ. While Phoenix is not known for its BBQ, we tried it out anyways, knowing that we're all hungry and could carve out any meat given in our direction.\n\nwe were dead wrong! we were expecting it to be another overrated and overpriced Lucille's BBQ down in California but oh my, we found a gem in Phoenix. We ordered the three meat platter and oh boy, it was good. me and my gf shared the platter, we got the st louis ribs, the brisket and the pork. the ribs were great, it falls off the bone and it's so juicy and tender. one of the best ribs i ever tasted, period. the brisket were unbelievable. smoked right, you'll taste every flavor of it. salty, meaty, and juicy, we were all happy just to be there at that time.\n\nif you visit phoenix, make sure to visit BOBBY Q as it will never let you down!"
Five,"One of my favorite things to do in the valley. Warning: this isn't your everyday hike - it's more like an intense climb. Be sure to pack lots of water and wear appropriate clothing (I always feel sorry for tourists I see that are wearing flip flops, jeans or other uncomfortable hiking gear).\n\nAlthough it's a bit strenuous, it's a fantastic workout and has beautiful views from the top! \n\nParking at Echo Canyon can be a nightmare on the weekends, so try to go super early or have someone drop you off/pick you up."

Five,"Can't get enough of BLT Steak!  I took my kids to happy hour just so they could enjoy the food.  Shrimp cocktail is only 3 shrimp, but must be almost equal to 1 lobster tail in size.  The shrimp are huge and fresh.\nThe Hamachi is delicious, but don't expect to fill up on it.  Great mix of flavors and spices. The Calamari dish is also a small portion, but has great flavor.  \nAnother good dish is the short rib sliders.  Great portion of meat and a favorite lunch dish for my son.\nThe steak tartare is great with the small quail egg.  A great mix of meat and acidic flavors. \nIf you need a large dish go with the flat bread dish.  2 types of cheese, balsamic, and arugula.  Large flat bread cooked on wood.  Great flavors with the Prosciutto.  If you like ham you have to try prosciutto.\nAnother larger dish is the BLT camelback burger.  Angus beef and great seasoning and ingredients.  \n\nYou have to go during happy hour and eat in the small bar area.

Four,"""My family and I love this place.

Five,"I didn't expect to find a place with some old style BBQ surroundings in Scottsdale. I had the half slab baby backs $16.99, comes with 2 sides, and comes with cornbread. The cornbread, well is a little different, darker, and denser than most, tasted ok. I had cole slaw which was slightly sweet and very good, and the spicy fries which were not very spicy but cooked very well and taste near perfect. The Ribs, moist, smoky, and a nice rub. It all comes with a fry pan of BBQ sauce. The sauce is slightly sweet, hot and very good.\nI saw someone else get a sandwich, and it had almost 2 inches of meat on it. Maybe that's next.\nFast subdued friendly service and odd, funny signs on the walls, sure this is Scottsdale? I highly recommend it"
Two,"Went here with a friend who is from the area, I must say at first walking in I was not impressed with the service at all.

Low and behold after 6-7 minutes he turns to seat us, he was the hostess after all.\n\nWe were her for lunch the parking lot and dining room we sat in were pretty full, nothing fancy at all.  I don't think anything has been updated in about 20 years or so. \n\nThe waitress was no better, she gave us our waters and didn't return to take our order for a good 15 minutes.  I had a shredded beef taco and a green chili tamale, again not impressed.  The taco was typical the tamale was loaded with way too much melted cheese on top so all you could taste was the cheese.  My friend had the steak fudido which she says is the best she has ever had.  I do admit it was pretty tasty and the meat was very flavorful.

Our choices were the proscuitto & fig, pulled pork (wow!), roasted garlic (also wow) and fresh mozz/tomato/basil.

One,"I first had Smashburger in Florham Park, NJ when they opened up there, about a year ago. I vowed never to return. Obviously I can't stick to my vows. I found myself in the dismal Tempe Marketplace trying to decide which restaurant to avoid, and after a process of elimination, I ended up going to Smashburger. Now I remembered why I vowed never to go back. I don't think America is overweight, I think this country is bloated from water retention due to the excessive salt, places like this use. If the meat doesn't have any flavor why does anyone believe that a good salt lick is the way to go? The Smashburger is just salty, there is no real flavor other than salt. I think it would be too salty for the Morton girl. I forgot how hideous the sweet potato fries were. Rosemary? Does not work - at all. The sweet potato is flavorful on its own. If you fry it correctly, the natural sugars will caramelize and produce a nice crunchy, sweet fry. You can accent its flavor with  sea salt, but I fear telling these people to salt anything will result in a sodium overdose. Do they own stock in a salt mine near the Black Sea?\n\nIt is very clear to me that making a really good burger is actually more of a challenge, one that Smashburger is clearly not up to. Sarah S. I was disappointed!"

I did not want to soil the impression that I already had in my head! Our group usually has 35 - 45 people in attendance. This week we exceeded our previous numbers with 67. Liberty Market stepped up to the challenge beautifully! \n\nThe service was phenomenal! The servers made light conversation and really tried to anticipate the needs of the customer. The place has an old-timey feel to it. This is a great place to bring the family or a casual date.\n\nThe food is simple but fabulous. I have had the wood-fried pizzas on both occasions (different toppings each time) and loved flavorings. Being a vegetarian, sometimes it is tricky to find things I want and can eat. I do not have any issues finding something to eat. Most of my friends are not vegetarians and they also loved what they ate.\n\nI highly recommend trying out Liberty Market for yourself."
Four,"Turf is a great neighborhood bar. If you like to go somewhere, sit outside on the patio, sip a Hoegaarden, and enjoy the complimentary WiFi, then this is your place. Here you'll find the typical pub-style food, and while satisfying for what it is, don't expect to be wow'ed over. That said, weekend brunch isn't that bad and the price is good.\n\nDuring some evenings they have live music and the place becomes quite packed with patrons. As Turf lies within easy walking distance of the downtown ASU campus and the light rail, they are just as accessible as say Rula Bula is on Mill Ave in Tempe.\n\nOverall, a great hang out neighborhood pub."
One,"Ended up spending $40 on a margarita, three beers, and one entree during happy hour. (I still tipped, the waiter was friendly and it's not his fault everything but the Corona tasted like a sweaty butt crack).\n\nThe dark bock microbrew tastes like bitter, cheap sake and smelled like margarita mix. The regular margaritas taste like corn syrup and wetnaps. The food was average and way overpriced. The red sauce tastes like spicy, water potting soil. I ate some of my sister's food as I didn't even order anything because they were charging $16 for a freaking chicken fajita. But the worst thing was the swarm of flies buzzing around our table on the newly-enclosed patio. I was swatting the air like a schizophrenic hobo."
Five,"As a beer lover and a person who likes to try different beers any chance I can, I totally dig The Lost Leaf. It's such a laid back place where you can go to sip on some beer, chat with whoever you are there with, and listen to some live music. Even with the live music, it's still possible to carry on a conversation which I appreciate. Beer prices seem to range from $3 to $10 just depending on what you get. The beer menu is quite lengthy, but beware that they may be out of what you want (I found this out this past Saturday night when we were there). However, the bartenders are super friendly and will offer up some other suggestions for you if they are out of what you initially wanted. \n\nOn Saturday night, I saw some people drinking wine, so you don't have to be a beer person to enjoy the LL atmosphere. But if you do love beer, LL is a must to check out."
Three,"Maybe I was there at the wrong time and ordered the wrong thing.  I have heard people RAVE about this joint.  Anyhoo, went in for lunch around 1 on a Wed.  We literally waited about 5 min to be greeted by the server and another 15-20 to get our drinks, which had to be brewed. Given it was good coffee and tea, but 20 minutes to get a drink on the table is silly.  You have to ask for water, as they dont serve it automatically, and the bread and tapanade came well before the drinks.  The tapanade and bread was pretty damn good. I ordered the Carne Asada Tacos, and they were very fresh tasting, but rather flavorless otherwise.  It came with a nice salad with cranberries, which was pretty good. The food was good, but not great.  The freshness factor was the most distinguishable flavor.  It would have been amazing if it were fresh and tasty. The server was just fine, and it was mod-high-mod for lunch price wise."
Five,"""Very good but let's start from the beginning.\n\nThe bread and dips were good.I recommend only dipping the \chippy\"""" bread in the green guacamole looking dip. The brownish dip had almost every single flavor and was not very good.\n\nThe Curry Chicken was very good and no doubt about it I would get it again. Also the Korma Lamb was AWESOME!!!!!!!!!! It had a very good sauce around it. The Tandoori Shrimp came with perfectly cooked onions and the shrimp was perfect too. Also the garlic strips are plain.    \n\nSome of the downsides are just slow service and really bad drinks. Don't get any sodas! I'm telling you this is great food!"""""""
Five,"""I have gained a lot of weight over time and I realized it is time to start to bring it back down some.  So I looked up yoga (was interested in something that wouldn't agitate my patella femoral syndrome) and this is the closest one to me (and I trusted yelpers!).  This studio seems to be exactly what I needed.\n\nI have been experimenting with at-home workouts but I just couldn't get myself to stay on them for very long at a time to make it worth it.\n\nI started a week ($20) and was tired and sore and I kept coming back to \get my money's worth\"""" and by the end of the week, I was actually thinking, my sinus feels a little better, I'm going to keep going to see how I feel.  I also enjoyed the teacher calling my name out to tell me I'm doing something wrong (I enjoy it more when they tell me \""""it's good\"""" though) and feel like it's the attention I need to improve myself.\n\nI am now 2 and a half weeks and am actively trying to average 5 days/week (13 classes out of 17 days so far).  I am completely amazed with how my body has changed so far.  I am way more flexible than I have been in a long time.  I don't see any other big changes yet but I go just for that fraction of a bit better each time I go back to class and feel happy about it.\n\nDo note, Bikram Yoga is hot and humid and I seem to always question myself in the middle why I keep coming back.  \nPersonally, when I am out though, I am glad I went (except for that one time I ate a combo meal at Chino Bandido's [Jade red in a Quesadilla is awesome!] before hand)."""""""
One,Not much of a resort. I would have been very disappointed if we would have got a room there for a true resort stay.  We stayed there for the Cavecreek Wicked Halloween event. They did have a 24 hr shuttle which was great in that situation. The room was still better than the drunk tank but not by much. The room was very dated.  It didn't even have a fridge.  The lobby and grounds were nice for the most part but all in all I was not impressed. I have stayed at Holiday Inn Expresses nicer.
Four,"This January trip was a bit daunting and my mom had asked that I pick up a headboard for her from Costco the morning I was leaving. Since I was having breakfast with a girlfriend close by, I decided I would check out this Costco instead of having to brave the one closer to Sun City again. \n\nI arrived here close to opening time on a Sunday morning, easily found parking and didn't have to do any navigation through the Sun City crowd. Due to the largeness of the item I had to purchase, my friend met me here after breakfast and helped me lug the headboard onto the cart and waited with it while I brought the car to the front of the store. Luckily, a really nice worker loaded it in with no hassels. \n\nThis Costco location would have been a life saver for me when I worked in the area some almost 8+ years ago. I don't think they have a gas station but I didn't look down the other end of the parking lot. All I know is that I was able to get what I needed and able to get out in a jiffy."
Four,"I've only gone to the Capital Grille for work-sponsored lunches and dinners so it's easier for me to rank it higher since cost isn't really an issue. If I had to pay for it myself, it would end up as a more special occasion or i-need-a-pick-me-up-lunch type of place. I really like the Capital Grille because even though the focus is on higher end meat and seafood, the vegetarian options are particularly good which is hard to come by at most restaurants in the same category. The Cobb salad (you can get vegetarian) is great because it's big, filling, and fresh. The veggie plate you can special order is a perfect entree, and though it's basically just a combination of all the side veggie dishes I think the sum is definitely greater than the parts. There are buttery roasted mushrooms covered in garlic & rosemary & thyme, grilled asparagus, sauteed spinach, and roasted tomatoes that add a wonderful sweetness and acidity to the dish."
Five,"The Cobbler Factory is an incredible institution.  They are family run, and were originally located in East Pasadena, just off of Colorado Blvd (in fact they sold the biz some other folks).  They now do the farmer's markets in Phoenix.\n\nThe cobbler is really fantastic.  It's one of the few things we make an extra trip to go and try and get, when we're in town.\n\nWhy do I like their cobblers so much?  Hmm, where to begin.  First, the crust is delicious.  Not too light, and not overloaded with shortening.  The syrup of the cobbler is probably my favorite.  It's super buttery, but also has a nice note of honey to it. I'm not sure if there is honey, but that's me.\n\nFinally, it has a really nice note of nutmeg, which gives it bite.  I love both the peach and apple best, but my wife likes the berry ones.   You know it's good when that's your primary source of food for lunch!?\n\nThey're not gorgeous to look at, but they taste awesome.  I only wish they were located closer to the East Coast, as that's where we live now."
Five,"""I am a new patient to Sonoran Hills Dental.  I have got to say the treatment was first class.  From the reception desk, dental hygienist, all the way up to Dr. Ito.  I was treated with respect, which is huge with me.  Every procedure was explained thoroughly and if I had any questions......they listened and took the time to answer my questions.  Dr Ito was caring and warm and seemed like a \down to earth\"""" kind of man.  I would recommend my new dental office to anybody that looks for any of the qualities above."""""""
Five,"The paletas are absolutely delicious! From the first bite, you know that they use fresh ingredients. The pineapple paleta is very fresh and not artificially sweet. The pecan paleta is a surprise. You can definitely taste that the pecans were roasted to perfection. \n\nIt was my first time here and the guy working at the shop was very helpful. He explained to us the process of making the paletas we got and answered my questions about some of their paletas. \n\nHighly recommended. With less than $3 for each paleta, it definitely beats going to any of the frozen yogurt stores on Mill."
Five,"I went there last Saturday right after my 6 hours intense exam, it's a long drive from Mesa.  The waiter was very nice and helpful, I got seated right away without waiting, it's weekend, so the restaurant was very crowded. I ordered a crawfish platter, which I have been missing for quite a long time and Pappadeaux seems the first decent seafood restaurant I found that serve crawfish.  Both the service and the food were excellent.  I just feel the sauce was a bit spicy for me, should have told waiter to make it less spicy.  I also like the environment outside the restaurant, very pretty view~   I would definitely go back and try some more dishes if I am in Phoenix area next time and feel ok with long drive."
Five,"I had to take my car to Scottsdale Lexus for service when Lao Thai caught my eye. I yelped it and reviews convinced me to stop. I usually hit noodles ranch when I'm over this way but wanted to branch out. I'm so happy I did! Absolutely loved my lunch here! I love veggies and chicken and spicy food, so I ordered Tge garden delight with chicken and asked to make it spicy. It was so freaking good I texted my man to make him jealous to ensure my return to this place. I like it HOT and was thrilled to see the four different kinds of chili paste they brought to the table. Some of the best and hottest I have had. I was in heaven! The weekly lunch special comes w soup and eggroll for like $7.95 or something. It was alot of food for few bucks. Can't beat that! I can't wait to return!"
Four,"This place is fantastic for vegans! Phoenix does not have a ton of breakfast options for vegans and it is so nice to discover a new place. They have 5 options for vegan breakfast, and also vegan pancakes which were not advertised but apparently there. They seem to know what they are doing as well, all the vegan meals come out on different color plates then non-vegan meals, which is somehow comforting. The staff was very friendly and totally accommodating. The place is cute, more cafeteria style and laid back which is perfect for a morning breakfast. Sitting outdoors was great, there is a beautiful view of the mountains. Overall, I would say this is a new Phoenix favorite for me!"
Five,"Now that I'm living in AZ full time, I need to hit Dilly's as often as I can. The sandwiches and wraps are still great! The Poore Bros chips are still fantastic. I'm a big fan of the BBQ Ranch flavor. I never stray from the goodness of these flavor of chips.\n\nMy favorites sandwiches are the humdinger, dilly club and then the mexi, southwest and chicken cesar wraps\n\nYou can't go wrong with any of the sandwich choices on the menu. The cookies are very tasty!\n\nAll sandwiches and wraps are $6.99 and come with your choice of a side and a pickle spear.\n\nDuring the peak lunch hour, you wait in line a bit or struggle to find a table to sit.. Order usually come out within 5-10 minutes during peak time."
Two,"I've never eaten a mouthful of sand, but if I did, I can't imagine it would taste much different than the rice and beans served at Tacos Del Mar. \n\nIf it is the goal of TDM to produce the most bland tasting Mexican food on the planet, they are doing a pretty good job.\n\nIn addition to the rice and beans, not much can be said for their dry, flavor-free steak as well.  If you're into eating cardboard, I suggest you try TDM's steak tacos. You'll be in heaven.\n\nI'd give the place one star if it weren't for the friendly employees. Those bastards."
Three,"This was one of the first restaurants I visited on my first visit to AZ.  It made quite an impression!  Any place that provides a free cookie with an entre deserves mention in my book.  Though they have since taken away my favorite sandwich (which featured, tomato, basil and mozarrella), there are still many tasty options!  The tomato soup is a hit with everyone I know!  The salads, especially the caesar salad and the pasta salads, are exquisite!  All the bread tastes pretty fresh to me, but I generally stick to soups and salads here now.  The chocolate chip cookies are great, and they usually give out samples!  I also enjoy the frequent diner rewards program, which rewards a free drink and then a free sandwich, etc. after several have been purchased."
Four,"I have known about this place for years, but just went for the first time last week as a default when we discovered that the Big Fat whatchamacallit place across the street had closed. What a nice surprise. The staff was very friendly although they hovered a bit too much for my liking. The food was spectacular, and as a vegetarian I had a lot to choose from (although the menu needs some help; things marked with an asterisk are supposed to be vegetarian, but there were asterisks dotted all over fish dishes). The array of desserts was to die for. My main complaint? Pricey like woah. And it was sneaky pricey. There were three of us; our main dishes were $10-$12 each, with a $9 appetizer, 3 desserts, cocktails, etc. and the bill was over $160!!! I thought my poor boyfriend was going to crap himself.  I honestly don't know how it got that expensive. The drinks? The desserts? Were the baskets of pita $8 apiece? I mean, a Greek meal costing  more than a steak extravaganza at Cork and Cleaver? Come on. While all three of us just loved it (a rarity, as we are all differently picky), at that price, it's going to have to be reserved for special occasions. Sheesh!"
One,"""I purchased a weed eater about 1 year ago and the clerk told me if I paid an additional amount I could get the 2 year Extended Protection Plan.  I don't like having to work on them so I went ahead and purchased the Extended Protection Plan.  She said all I ever need to do is to bring it back with the receipt and it would be replaced for any reason.  Well It doesn't work now so I took it in with the highly coveted receipt that we diligently kept on file for low the last year and guess what?  You got it.  I somehow failed to comb over the accompanying documentation with all of the , \fine print\"""", that I received with my receipt and Extended Protection Plan and therefore I was not aware that I must register this weed eater with an outside company.  Even the floor manager seemed surprised that the office folks were sending me to tool rental then back again over a 20 minute period to finally get to the bottom line which is this; they will send it out for service for $35.00 diagnostic.  I told them to never mind because I would be more content to throw it out the window at a passing car on my way to purchase a new one at Lowes."""""""
Three,"""I went here due to a Restaurant.com coupon. The menu was expensive, which made me think that it was a fancy place, but it turns out that the food was expensive because it was a restaurant inside a hotel! It was inside the Sheraton and I didn't see any signs outside indicating it was there. We'd made reservations since it was a Friday night, but they really weren't necessary, as there were only two other families in the restaurant. We'd dressed up. We were the only ones.\n\nThe restaurant area was really very modern beautiful. They'd made good use of lighting effects and there was a large, full bar wrapped along the back portion.\n\nWe ordered the Pan-Seared Cheese (which were basically fried cheese poppers - delicious, but definitely overpriced considering only 4 of them came on a plate) as an appetizer. My date ordered the Baron's Burger (your basic burger), and I ordered the Valley of the Sun Ribs. The ribs were a little dry, but I really loved the \Arizona croquette\"""" that came with them. It was fried crispy on the outside with creamy mashed potatoes on the inside.\n\nWith the restaurant.com coupon, the meal was reasonably priced, but without it, I would have felt a little ripped off."""""""
Two,"""I really don't know what's been going on with my countenance lately. Clearly, the expression on my face as I meander through these janked-out businesses in Phoenix is one that seems to scream out that I'm some kind of dumbass with a big, Santa-sized sack of cash that I just can't wait to get rid of. It's not just this place either, I somehow have had the same annoyance at a few different stores lately. \n\nI don't really understand when the word \No\"""" ceased to mean, well NO, and started instead to mean \""""Keep talking because I am just as moronic as you and might buy into your bullshit.\"""" \nTHREE times I had to say NO to this buffoon who tried to sell me a warranty for a pair of shoes so that they would last me a year in the Arizona sun. He was quite authoritative on his weather report and science project explaining me how the glue on the sole would separate. Really? Because I actually use my RUNNING shoes for - guess what - RUNNING, and as such, I replace them every six months - at the most. Furthermore, if the blast of heat when it really starts to get going out there was enough to melt a pair of shoes as I wear them, then wouldn't the world be coming to a nuclear end? \nThree times I said no.

Four,"This place has a good system- you pick out your flavor of yogurt and toppings and make it any way you want then just weigh it at the end. I'm sure there are strategies to this, but I just had some mint chocolate concoction and it was pretty good. It was about 4 dollars for a half filled bowl. I put on some thin mint cookie crumbles. Service was fine for me, not sure what the other complaints are about."
Five,"""A tiny strip mall located family owned business.  For those who know anything about valley food; that means you're usually going to find something great.  If you like Mediterranean, there's something at Eden's Grill Inn that will satisfy your taste buds.\n\nI've had a few of Eden's Grill's platters at a party before, but this weekend was my first dining experience at the restaurant.  The dining room is small.  Probably not much bigger than my living room, but they manage to comfortably squeeze a good mount of tables in without it getting uncomfortable.  Some music (I'm assuming Greek) gives the place some added feeling.  The decor isn't much.  A few paintings and a lot of the clique \Best\"""" whatever they were vote from the New Times or some other publications plaque's.  Those awards seem to be well deserved.\n\nWe both had the gyro pita lunch special.  For just $7.95, you get the sandwich, a choice of Greek salad, fries, or rice, and a drink.  When the sandwich arrived, I was shocked at the massive amount of meat.  I had to start with a fork just to eat it down to a size where I could use my hands and take a bit!  The tzatziki sauce is also excellent.  I'm guessing they mix some sort of sour cream in with the yogurt.  Whatever it is, it makes the sauce very flavorful.  The pita bread may be the best I've ever had.  It's almost more of a hybrid or a naan and a pita.  A little oily for bread, but delicious.  The service was as good as the food.  The owner really made us feel welcome, and was as nice as can be.\n\nThe lunch specials are cheap.  The regular entrees can be pretty pricy.  But portions are pretty big, so it's best to come here with a group of at least four and split a few items."""""""
Four,"CLOSED MONDAYS. Not in a great part of town. Park in back, or across the street. The day we visited CNN was doing a piece on the chef. Try the Guacamole (it has Pomegranate seeds) w very fresh tortillas). Filete de Tita ($26) Filet Mignon with Mash Potatoes with chorizo, Crab, Blue Cheese (smoky, Flavorful, spicy). Some overcooked some undercooked. Definitely get dessert &  coffee (big French press with a very robust coffee) a must is the Churros filled with Caramel."
Four,"We found this place through Grub Hub- we have never been to the resturant itself but we have ordered their food for three nights and we tried a little bit of everything. Their eggplant parm is amazing and very tasty. Its as if they add something 'extra' to the breading that other places don't. My husband had a sandwich and he said the filling was great along with the dressing but the bread was a bit hard. \n\nThe appetizers don't fail- I go for the appetizer that has cheese sticks, zuchnni, mushrooms and artichoke hearts in it and it really wonderful. The deserts also don't fail. \n\nWe did try the stuffed pizza and we had mixed reviews here- I love it, my daughter loved it but since it was stuffed with ricotta cheese and my husband not being a fan of ricotta it didn't go over too well. The large pizza is HUGE to say the least and they don't skimp on toppings. \n\nI recommend this resturant if you want pizza, pasta or even a slice of cheesecake but their sandwiches could use better quality of bread..Other then that, Its a great place to eat and get your comfort food fix."
Five,"I have been seeing Khristine since before I was officially Jewish, which is a long time ago now. But that's neither here nor there. She is amazing at creating color that complements your attitude and skin complexion. Basically, she's a magician. Every time I leave Khristine's salon, I feel good about myself. I also feel confident that I can somewhat recreate what she's made on a daily basis. So glad to have found her! P.S. Her new studio is a private space and it makes you feel VIP."
Three,"I FINALLY got around to visiting this tiny boutique.  Unfortunately, as much as I found in there that I liked and wanted, I probably won't be back any time soon to actually buy anything.  I was glad to have a generous gift certificate from my sister to spend! \n\nLike everyone else said - things here are REALLY pricey.  There were a few handmade things that I could understand having a high price, but.... $90 for a wallet??  Yikes.  Don't get me wrong, I know local stuff costs more, I just didn't think it cost THAT MUCH more...\n\nI can see myself coming back when I'm looking to treat myself to some unique jewelry or when I'm looking for a special gift for a close friend or family member.  Sadly, though, it won't be added into my rotation when I head out to shop."
Three,"""I figured this place was doing things right when all the parking spots within a 200 foot radius were taken.\n\nThe fam and I were visiting from SoCal and had a hankering for some cheap Viet grub. Y'see, you don't drop a lot of money to get filled up at places like these. For around 35 bucks the whole family can eat their hearts out. Here, you get all the top entrees, phos, bobas and appetizers. Our good friends who lived in the area recommended this joint. The restaurant's locale is dusty and isolated at the end of a semi-deserted strip mall, near a busy intersection. \n\nThe place felt a little worn down and needed some refreshing. But that won't stop folks from frequenting this place. The food came fast, in larger than average portions and service was attentive. It was tricky finding the bathroom though. The quality of food was pedestrian, nothing ground breaking or causing everyone at the table to say, \Oooooh....!\"""" Yes, I've had better at other Viet places but this place did the job without making me puke or emptying my wallet. \n\nAll in all, it was a decent experience."""""""
Two,"Great name, great location ... \nRight outside the Mekong supermarket ... really can't beat that ... \nI guess given its geographic advantage, the quality is only secondary. \n\nI went there twice, the first time, my impression was OK pho as I was with a group of friend and didn't pay as much attention.\n2nd time... went there after grocery in Mekong and paid a bit more attention to the food .... honestly, it's really just a OK, or can I say OK-minus\n\nIf you were in the area and looking for good pho, I would recommend to go across the street to Blue-Moon. Much cheaper (like $5-6 vs $8+) .. i know we are talking about 2 bucks .... but hey that's like 40%, and the quality is much better...  \nBut if you were really craving for pho and can't just wait to cross the street, this is a OK place."
Two,"I shake my fist at Sochu House. We went on opening night, and it was beyond terrible. Our friends went back. It's great, they said. No really, the food is great and the service is much better, they said. GIVE IT ANOTHER TRY, they said.\n\nOur friends are idiots.\n\nSat at the bar. Dead on a Friday night--this should have been a sign to us, but we bellied up anyway.  Our bartender was obviously new. There was another older female bartender wearing glasses who was SO RUDE--not to us, but to every other staff member there who asked her a question or crossed her path. It made us uncomfortable to watch...keep the bitchiness in the kitchen, it's unprofessional. \n\nWe started with a couple of drinks and ordered a bottle of water. They fumbled for a minute and couldn't find any bottled water. He finally offered us regular water, and said something about the person who orders the bottled water going into labor that day. Only one person at the entire restaurant can place the order for bottled water? You know what I call that? Job security.  \n\nFood wasn't much better than the service, which shockingly didn't improve over the course of the evening. Sugar cane pork was sort of dry. Chicken lollipops were okay, but pretty damn saucy. Why is there so much sauce on everything? Larry David would not approve. The pot stickers went untouched, which in turn went unnoticed by our bartender. The udon was decent (although I would skip the shrimp), but by that time we were full of mediocre appetizers. When we asked for the check, we had a full bowl of udon and a mostly full plate of pot stickers sitting in front of us. No one asked if everything was okay, or if we wanted a box. I asked for a box (our dog would eat the pot sticker meat fo sho), and it never came. Just like we'll never come back."
Five,"I liked this place. The reviews show low stars but I liked it. I was there for happy hour so go at that time. The pricing is good. I don't know about dinner, but happy hour is cool.  Servers were chill.  Host was a bit stuck up. Not sure why she though she was that great. But the place is cool. I recommend people check it out if they want to try a sushi place on the Mill ave when you are in town visiting Tempe."
Two,"Based strictly on the resort and room, I would have given this place more stars.  The rooms were nice and quite comfortable.  Although the bathroom did get soaked with every shower since there wasn't any sort of barrier to keep the water in.  \n\nThe reason I gave it fewer stars is because of the headache I am still experiencing several months later.  I had incorrect charges from someone else's spa package that were charged to my room, which I was told were taken care of twice after they made me swear I didn't go to the spa.  Uh, the person staying in that room was a 23 year old man who was with us the entire time, and I'm pretty sure he doesn't get manis/pedis and facials on the reg.  But, yes, everything was cleared up after a few phone calls.\nSecond, because of plane trouble we ended up not checking in until 6 in the morning, and we were told they would not charge us for those two rooms for the night before.  That was a lovely surprise!  Then they did.  I just wanted clarification, and after multiple phone calls, messages, and finally a terse message left with the GM, I finally was told the charges would fall off my card in February.  Guess what....  It's April.  Charges are still there.  I've left more messages... no return calls.\n\nSo, needless to say, I would recommend it, but double-triple check your bill and be prepared to argue."
Three,"I can Pho-give this place for decent service.  Granted, my group of 8 was the only one around that quiet night.  My Pho was pretty good, I think I finished before everyone around the table, but I have a big mouth.  Everyone else seemed to enjoy their food or maybe it was just good company :)  I love the decor; felt like I walked into one of my old school relatives homes - tacky Asian art with a modern twist.  They have a small wine selection, wow!  Never really gone into a Pho place with a plethora of wine!  Maybe next time I feel like eating Pho and talking about my failed relationships I'll be back ;-P enjoy!"
Five,"I have driven by US Eggs several times on my way in or out of Old Town Scottsdale.  US Eggs has to have one of the tallest buildings I have ever seen for a restaurant.  One morning, I decided to give it a shot.  I did a little research on Yelp, and I saw that people enjoyed the protein pancakes.  I eat quite a bit of protein supplements, so I was wondering if they somehow infused whey protein powder into the pancake batter.  It actually has fresh blueberries, cinnamon, and almonds.  I think the batter had whole grain wheat.  I decided to go with the half and half, which gave me 2 mini protein pancakes (humongous) and an Idaho Skillet that came with potatoes, your choice of 1 egg, and a type of sauce such as Cajun spices, Santa Fe, or various other assortments.  Each of my friends got the same dish, but with different skillet sauces.  We enjoyed the Cajun, Santa Fe, and chicken avocado.\n\nThe best part of the experience is that you definitely get your money's worth.  If you ever have a hard workout or are extremely hungry, come to US Eggs for a power-packed breakfast."
Four,"Went there last Friday for Happy Hour since we always go to Ef Hefe for football games on Sunday's...  This place blew our socks off in comparison to Ef Hefe.  First off the bartender introduces himself and shakes out hand - nice Jesse.  They had pretty fair happy hour prices and selection of food; we had wings and chicken fingers - both good but the string fries were the best : )  The bartender was very attentive and friendly chat, something that never happens next door.  Now I can see why this place is packed on Sundays especially if you are a Cardinals fan.    Cheers to Jesse for the great service."
Four,"I'm upgrading my review for the sole reason that the St Louis ribs are fabulous. I take mine naked, and I've never been disappointed...\n\nFamous Dave's isn't bad for a chain restaurant. It has all the annoying chain restaurant decor and lack of actual character (down to a poor employee dressed as a pig), but those negatives are offset by decent food and service.\n\nThe pulled pork is fine, though a little dry and sometimes a burned chunk can show up on your plate. The sauces are good, with several options on your table. The corn bread muffins are fine, but the corn on the cob is typically overcooked. They do have fantastic coleslaw and great beans, so if you pick your sides carefully, you can end up with a good meal.\n\nI don't like the restaurant area (too many people, too much clutter on the walls, too noisy and too many wandering pig mascots), so I generally sit in the relative peace of the bar. It's a good option for a pre-movie dinner at Mesa Riverpoint."
Three,"Another disappointed visit.  I am starting to think this isn't a fluke and PB has lost it's magic touch.  We went for my wife's birthday around 4pm on a Wednesday.  We actually walked right in and sat down.  We were both shocked as the least amount of time we have ever waited was well over 3 hours.  \n\nThe staff was more attentive on where we sat than giving us a genuine greeting even though the place was empty except two other tables.  We put in our order for a margherita with prosciutto, a wise guy, and a caprese salad.\n\nThe bread came out cold with some oil to dip it in.  I can't remember if it was always cold but it would be nice if they threw it in the oven for 30 seconds before they serve it to you.  Next our pizzas came out and the margherita was missing the prosciutto.  Not a big deal.  Maybe he didn't hear me, maybe the cook didn't hear him?  My wife confirms I did request it and I'm not losing my mind.  The pizzas were good but lacking the usual special touch.  The crust was the best part which is not unusual but what was unusual was the rest was very lack luster.\n\nEven though the shop was dead our waiter never came back to us and was back behind the bar laughing and chatting with other staff members.  Finally a blonde woman asks if we would like our bill.  She brings it to us and when I give her my card I gently advise her they forgot my prosciutto and it's on the bill.  Another guy brings the bill back for me to sign.  The 6 dollar prosciutto is still on it.  I inform him that there was no prosciutto and I told the other woman but it's still here.  I don't know if she thought I was just making small talk or what but I sure am not paying 6 bones for some sliced ham that wasn't even on my pizza.  He took care of it.\n\nHere's the deal.  I don't know if it's because I didn't wait 3-5 hours to eat or if it's just falling apart without Chef Bianco but PB has definitely lost it's way and is quickly losing the legacy he created whether they want to acknowledge it or not.  I used to think the staff was short and slightly rude because of how busy it was and dealing with upset starving customers brings them down but now I know that is not the case.  They are just not good at what they do and have been there getting away with it for too long.  Just because PB is famous and Chef Bianco is world renown doesn't mean you are.  \n\nThe dough is good enough to come back for but there is simply no way I would ever wait in line to eat here again.\n\nIf you read my previous review you will see I am not a PB hater and actually was a huge advocate.  I guess all good things really do come to an end."
Four,"""Was here several weeks ago for a business dinner and it was awesome!\n\nWe had been there several times for happy hours, which was always good and were really excited to go for a full dinner.\n\nWe were not disappointed!  The service was excellent with several wait staff working our table and lots of attention given to us.  The only negative I would comment on was our waiter kept calling us \guys or you guys\""""!!  That was tacky and annoying.\n\nThe steaks were amazing;  The best I have ever had and the sides were perfect as well.  \n\nThis is a great place to go that gives the customer all of the right stuff!  We will go back and look forward to another wonderful meal with great service!!\n\nHey you guys, give it a try!!  LOL.."""""""
Four,"I may be turning into a Chili's fan.  For years, I would have rated Chili's as thoroughly mediocre, with any other nearby restaurant rating higher than what it could bring.   Today I had a mesquite chicken salad sans tortilla chip shreds.  They kept the chips off (which was sort of surprising to me) and it was pretty good tasting.  \nThe server offered to split the checks which is nice and the server who brought out the food brought out the checks at the same time in case we were in a hurry.  My drink was kept filled without me having to ask for it and I think everyone else at the table enjoyed everything they were eating. \nWe did seem to have to go through a gauntlet of servers, hosts and managers lining the exit on the way out , but overall it was a good experience."
Two,"Are all grocery stores in Phoenix giant?  This one is huge.\n\nI didn't see any homeless people sitting around but there was a security guard on duty so that may have have something to do with it.\n\nWe got stocked up on road snacks for our drive back to the East Bay.\n\nWe also bought a small bottle of Vodka to enjoy one last drink as a night cap before our trip.\n\nThe cashier made all of us show I.D. Me, my sister and my husband.  We are all over 21.  Then the cashier forgot to put the vodka in our shopping bag.  (We only had one bag)\n\nWe got all the way to where we were staying then had to drive all the way back to get it.  I paid for it and I wasn't about to leave it sitting there.\n\nShe also asked if we had a V.I.P card and I said no because we live in California.  She didn't even offer to give us the V.I.P treatment.  At least at Safeway they ask if you know someone who does.\n\nI like Safeway better."
Four,"This is an upscale buffalo exchange. The clothes tend to still have their tags and are brand names like Kors, Vera Wang, DKNY, Sevens, French Connection, American Apparel, JCREW, etc. The clothes are in excellent quality too. There is a wide selection of dresses. They are pickier in what they purchase from you, but that is because they have a higher standard. The people who work here are very honest and helpful as well. When you sell back your clothes you can elect to get store credit, where they will give you more money or they will give you cash which will be less than the store credit. The only problem I have with this place is the hours. They never seem to be open when they say they are. It has happened to me a few times where I have gone there at noon or 1 and they are still not open even if the sign says open at 11. It sucks because this place is out of the way for me and when I make the trip out during their normal business hours I expect them to be open."
Two,"Went here for a business lunch today.  Can't give this place much more credence than I would an Applebee's, though.  Ordered the avacado turkyburger and requested well done steak fries.  Burger was dry and overly herby, fries were NOT well done and not even done-done in my opinion - sorta stale even.  Free corn bread is a nice perk cuz it's quite good and served very hot in a little fancy cast-iron pan with a big 'ol steak knife for servin' & a side a' butter.  Everyone you talk to who has been to Z'Tejas will mention the corn bread, the corn bread, the corn bread.  Yippie yay.   It managed to upstage my $11 turkey-blah-ger.  So, congrats, overachieving cornbread, to a job well done!\n\nService:  Our server was friendly and attentive and she let us talk prior to ordering without interrupting us.  Generally a good vibe here.\n\nFood overall is just...meh, in my opinion.  I didn't try my companions entrees at all, though they had no complaints.   The food here reminded me of Rainforest Cafe - the smells, the portions, the prices. Just not my thing."
Four,"Ever since Monroe's closed there's been a certain emptiness downtown. District doesn't necessarily fill the void, but it certainly provides momentary satiation. The live music (jazz) was great and not overpowering. The atmosphere and decor here are pretty great. It's dark, but not too dark. The music is loud, but not too loud.\n\nI had the buffalo ribeye per the bartender's recommendation and it was quite nice... a bit on the fatty/grisly side but it was seasoned and cooked to perfection. The mac-n-cheese side was a little underwhelming, especially because it had some wilted spring mix as garnish. The flavor was good, but my mac-n-cheese would dropkick this one to the moon.\n\nThe service was prompt and friendly and I would not hesitate to return."
One,"Oh god what a disaster.  The only thing that redeems this place was the cheap prices.  I've been to plenty of Chinese Buffets in my life and I drive by this one every day.  We finally had to go in and let me say - the quality of the decor matches the quality of food.  \n\nThe wallpaper is peeling, the floors look unwashed, and the tables are like something out of your work's lunch room.  \n\nThe waitress isn't bad, the cook seems to refresh the food often, and some of the dishes aren't disgusting.\n\nMost are though.  Too bad."
Four,"If you want to feel a little posh- then Postino is the place for you and your girlfriends.  I had girls night out there and we had a great time!  We are not heavy wine drinkers but my girlfriends love the dessert wine and the  bruschettas!!! We kept ordering it!!!  I personally like the riesling there.  My girlfriends and I will definitely come back for more bruschetta and I will come back for the riesling and the atmosphere.  This location is a perfect place for a date because it's low lighting giving off that warmth- maybe it's the wine as well...but who cares- you'll have a blast if you have several glass ;)\n\nThis location is missing a star because our server that night was very rude.\n\nOh and if you have cute girlfriends, maybe someone there will buy a bottle for your table ;)"
Three,"Central Grille has been slow to grow on me, but it's getting there. I have not had the pleasure of enjoying a full meal from Central Grille, but I have had many drinks and appetizers from there. \n\nThe staff is always friendly even laughing at some of the rowdy subject matter from conversations with friends. I feel that they're aiming for a Rat Pack lounge  type of vibe in the bar area, but they're just a bit off when it comes to the music. One evening there was a little old lady playing the piano, another time it was a guy strumming a guitar and singing very boring music. The bar area would be a cool spot to hang all night but the music kills it at times.\n\nI have tried a few of the appetizers which were a-ok, but one thing that was ordered that was AMAZING was the au gratin potatoes. YUM! I highly suggest you try them. Try them by themselves! You won't be sorry.\n\nI hope to visit Central Grille again soon to try their other menu offerings"
Two,"The reason I rated this so low is because I can never just get a table here.  It's always busy, it's cramped, and loud.  Sure the beer is great, and the food too... but it's never just easy to eat here.  Parking on the street stinks, and then waiting a half hour for a table is frustrating when there is no room for you to stand anywhere.  Otherwise, sure it's a fine bar.. but there are other bars in Tempe."
Three,"Bruce and I went to look at one of our listings in that part of town last week, God what a horrible little home. Well we decided we should reward ourselves for putting our senses in such shock that we decided to go to Mimi's. \n\nBruce being such a picky eater he does not have many places he will go. And by picky I mean odd. \n\nAny-road I have not been in several years and it was just as I remembered. A nice filling sandwich and cup of soup. It was all good and the service was just spiffy too. In fact when I asked where the rest room is, I was taken by hand and led there. A little strange actually, but great service."
Four,"Our office decided to celebrate Cinco De Mayo with some good mexican food.  The closest place was Macayo's.  \n\nWe ordered a platter to go.  It was a hit in the office.  We all chowed down on some mini chimis beef & chicken, mini rolled tacos, and mini tamales.  Very tasty, meat was moist, and the breading a little on the sweet side.  Chips and salsa were flavorful.  \n\nWe added our own virgin margaritas to the mix and had a party.\n\nWould love to go again and get more."
Four,"It was a Wednesday night and we were the only people there... We sat outside and brought the dog... (would be 3 stars but giving an extra star for being dog-friendly).  Travis, one of the wine makers was very attentive and had some good recommendations.  We had the cheese plate and a bottle of the cab-merlot mix.  We didn't finish the bottle, and it was no problem to cork and carry!  The cheese plate had 4 cheeses, dried apricots, fresh grapes, mixed nuts, a mustard, and crackers.  It was eh... cheese could've been better.  However, we will return - perhaps to make our own wine.  We agree with Ashley's review that Su Vino would be a great place to host a party.\n\n****One more thing - when you go to Su Vino, I highly recommend visiting the ladies bathroom - you'll see why!"
Three,"We went to the zoo this past Saturday because the weather was mild and beautiful and it seemed like a nice Memorial weekend activity. Apparently, a lot of other people had the same idea, because it was totally packed! Our favorite thing about the zoo was the way many of the habitats - most notably, that of the longhorns - was built into/around the natural desert landscape. Papago Peak was a gorgeous backdrop for the wildlife. One other really stand-out exhibit was the monkey habitat. There is a winding path through a bunch of trees, and the monkeys jump through the trees and even cross the path every so often. Less enchanting were the tiger and lion exhibits; the habitats were run-down, and the animals seemed lonely and restless. I have definitely been to better zoos, but this was a fun way to spend an afternoon on an unseasonably mild Phoenix afternoon."
Five,"Dear FEZ,\n\nWe have courted on several occasions. At first I thought maybe we were destined to be casual flings forever. I loved your eclectic style mixed with your sensuality. I've always loved that you filled your delicious martinis to the brim, but in the back of my head thought you were always just trying to get me drunk. Your menu begs me to keep coming back for more whenever I get the chance.\n\nHowever, you went above and beyond the other night, and it's all thanks to your delightful server Candace. She is a diamond in the rough and needs to be given a handsome bonus or raise. Do not reward her with vacation though, as I expect her schedule to follow my FEZ cravings from here on out :)\n\nFrom the get go, my crew of out of towners were suspicious they would not receive their food in time to enjoy it, not be rushed, and be able to make their flights back home. I was selfish and wanted to show them the best restaurant not in walking distance from the hotel and bussed them on the light rail to FEZ.\n\nWe informed the staff of our situation and apologized in advance. And we experienced the best service I have ever had probably anywhere in the valley. Our waters were delivered promptly (but without bendie straws.. slight sad face) and we ordered immediately after. Candace never minded repeating the drink menu items as we didn't have but one of those menus on the table for all 10 of us. \n\nOur food came out quickly and all at the same time. Drinks were delivered with flair. Everyone spent the first few minutes moaning in happiness. Following it were a few moments of extreme gratitude for the delicious food and then a lot more silence as we devoured our meals without feeling like we were in a hurry any longer. \n\nThe bills were brought out.. separate... to everyone right as some of us were about finished and needed to start thinking about a ride to the airport. It was beautiful. Despite gratuity being included, I believe we all included extra because we truly appreciated our service and meals that night.\n\nIn fact, I can never finish my fries and FEZ burger so I had half sitting there and one of my friends asked if they could have some of it as it was so delicious the first time he had it.\n\nI love you FEZ, and I always will. You truly impressed me all over again, and left a great impression of what Phoenix has to offer on visitors."
Four,"""Happy hour here is CRACKIN' although, I do have to agree with the whole old man and young blondes comment or the suger daddy thing. I came here twice in one day with a friend, we had cocktails the first time and had to catch a movie so we came back later for dinner.\n\nVisit 1\nFirey flame torches at the entrance..totally hot. Valet parking when there is available free parking 2 feet away ...totally trying too hard. Although the valet parking is only $3, they park your car next to someone who didn't valet..how dumb is that?! that's arizona trying to be California right there...\n\nDrinks were good, lotsa people a good mix of upbeat music and lotsa people looking like they're enjoying themselves. Only thing, our waiter seemd angry that we only ordered a drink so to make him happy we ordered another one. I left thinking this must be the hangout in Scottsdale.\n\nVisit 2 (1 bad movie and 3 hours later)\nWe were seated after the funny looks of \weren't you guys just here\"""" We had teppanyaki and a bottle of the Robert Hall wine recommended by our cute waitress. We got a table to ourselves and a crazy asian chef who had a strong yan can cook accent. Ironic though, I was thinking to myself, how do you find these people, I bet he speaks perfect english! So after our performance, he said \""""thank you have a good night\"""" in perfect english!!! wtf!? But the food was mediocre, lots of food came with our order, like rice, soup, etc..so even though the steak and seafood portion is smaller you're filled up. \n\nIll probably never come here again because I'm not from Arizona but I do recommend this for a hip place to be, it's got a great atmosphere and exceeded my non existant expectations of Asian food in Arizona. Ambiance is key here though"""""""
One,"If I could give this place 0 stars I would! Want there on Veterans Day for my fathers birthday. There was a group of about 15 of us in the bar. Only 4 tables in the dinning room with 3 servers and a manager. It took us 20 minutes to even get a drink order for me my mother my boyfriend and 20 month old son. At that point she was already trying to get a food order from us, are you kidding me?! Got our order in and being a waitress I always ask tables with. Kids if they want the kid food to come out first. Not only did she not ask, his come out last!\n\nMom got the brisket. I don't know why they even bothered to bring it out. You could see the fat just sitting on top. Got the salmon which was ok, but it was supposed to come with two sides but only got one. When I asked about it they aid they would get it. Maybe 5 minutes later got my Mac and cheese side. Lukewarm at best and the cheese on top wasn't even melted. My boyfriend never got one refill on his soda, even when he put it to the end of the table. \n\nNeedless to say it was a HORRIBLE experience and I will never be going back!"
Five,"We had a leak that Lyon roofing fixed a few years back that leaked again this year.  We called Tim at AVC and they came out the next day for an estimate.  We had three other estimates and they were lowest.  Tim took the time to explain the reason we have a leak spot, what the other company did wrong in their previous repair, how he was going to fix it so it won't re-occur, who was going to do it, how long it would take, materials they would use, etc..... In great detail they won my confidence and I hired them on the spot.  They came THE NEXT DAY!  The repair took several hours longer than they estimated, but there was no additional charge.  Also they noticed loose tiles and secured those, so they won't be an ongoing issue.  It is rare that you find a contractor so honest, so professional that you want to tell everyone you know...but these guys are it.  I highly recommend them for whatever your roofing project may be."
Four,"""We dined at Bourbon Steak to celebrate my husband's birthday this past June.

Three,"A cute little cafe with great decor, and serving an assortment of sweet and savory crepes! They also have a reeeally nice women's bathroom!\nIt's a great place to meet with friends or study, but as for the crepes, I've had better. Although they are reasonably priced, the ingredients don't seem that quality. (Maybe I'm spoiled from Crepevine) I ordered a turkey pesto crepe expecting actual turkey but it was just a couple pieces of packaged turkey slices. And though the pesto was tasty, it was clearly a store-bought spread. And the crepe itself was so-so. Guess I'll have to try a sweet crepe next time...\n\nAlso, the waitress wasn't that friendly, and the overall customer service wasn't great."
One,"""I was searching for a unique item to give as a Thank You gift and I stopped by Practical Art over the Labor Day weekend after viewing some items on their website.  I was extremely under underwhelmed by the service I received and do not plan on returning.  \n\nWhen I arrived the young woman behind the counter was having a personal conversation with an acquaintance.  Besides the employee and her conversation buddy the store was empty.  I spent about ten minutes looking around and the young woman did not have the common courtesy to acknowledge me with a simple \Hello\"""", even as I was viewing items directly in front of the counter.  When I was leaving the store she did break long enough to say \""""Bye\"""".\n\nI believe it is very important to support local business but I will not spend my money here.  I did find several items I wanted to buy and made note of the artist. I have done the extra leg work to reach out to them to find out how to purchase their items through other channels.

Five,"""I'm writing this update on Al-Hana to let everyone know they've made some changes recently and for the BEST! \n\nThe Baiz Market is pretty much the same.  It's a wonderful Middle Eastern and Mediterranean food market and THE BEST place to buy olives, oils, middle eastern spices and pita bread!!  2 for $1and it's fresh daily! \n\nAl-Hana~ \take a deep inhale as you enter the Baiz market, awe....\"""" It's the same wonderful aroma and quality of food but they've made some changes to their menu.  Yes, that's right I said menu.  They have menu's now!  They are nicely done with full color pics of most dishes so no more guessing and no need for an interrupter!\n\nTheir dishes have changed.  They've added rice to most of their dishes at no extra charge. In fact they lowered their prices on a lot of things and changed up a lot of their entries to include rice, hummus and garlic sauce! \n\nThe chicken and beef schawarma are both some of the best in town but I prefer the Shish Taook ~ two huge skewers of grilled to perfection chicken seasoned in taook spices on top of a large bed of seasoned and delicious rice served with hummus, mixed pickles, tomatoes and their garlic sauce.  It is a HUMONGOUS plate full of tasty goodness that comes with two fresh pitas on top.  It's enough food for two people, people!  So be ready to share.  Their garlic sauce and hummus are as good or better than anyone else's their Shish Taook will leave you wanting!\n\nI also recommend getting some of their small meat, cheese or cheese with spinach pies, the small square ones that are folded, heated for an appetizer and share a plate of hummus.  Their small pies are full of flavor and the pie dough is awesome!! \n\nPlan to par-ooze the market while you wait for your food.  Skip the pepsi coolers near the Al-Hana counter for your beverage and pick a beverage from the large coolers on the first aisle leading back to the produce.  This is where you'll find just about anything and everything from the middle east to drink.  Yes!\n\nThey still have the same wonderful team of two guys cooking and the young lady running 100 MPH taking orders and serving everyone all at once.  They have made some fantastic changes and they one of THE BEST places to go for your Middle Eastern and Mediterranean food fixes.  I hope to see you there!"""""""
Five,"I am not going anywhere else.\n\nBeen to several body shops (ya, don't ask. My cars tend to attract trouble: Hail, some dude/dudette running away after backing into my passenger side, Some pickup truck scrapping the side in a parking lot, and latest, metal plate falling from a truck ahead of me)\n\nI have never had a better experience than the one I had with Autobody World. Stacie called me and setup everything over the phone as I was traveling. Arranged for an after hour Towing of my car the garage. They accommodated our crazy schedule. \n\nStacie and Kari called us every other day and updated us in the progress in addition to sending me the detailed estimate. They worked with the insurance and had the car ready wen they promised they would.\n\nThe work looks very good. They have done a interior detail along with the cleaning of the car before they got it out for me.  I am not going anyplace else ever again."
Three,"This was a tough call. I reallllllllllly wanted to give it four stars. I mean the place is gorgeous. Great bar area, great dinner area, and the outside deck is just gorgeous....the bad part was the service. We were there on a Friday night and there were only four of us in our party. I think there may have been a total of 12 people in the whole place. And yet our waitress only came over to us once. And we ordered a lot of drinks that night. It was her loss. We had to keep walking up to the bar for our service. It was a very comfortable place. I haven't eaten there yet but I'd like to go back there for people watching and dinner perhaps."
Three,"This place is great for drinking with friends. Great for happy hour, and just basically meeting up with friends for dinner, drinks, and watching whatever sport event is on tv. This place can get pretty packed. Parking is a b*tch! Theres like no where to park. People pretty much jus come here to drink their beer and get wasted. Food is alright. Decent price for pitchers of beer, about $17? for kilt lifter. This is your typical crowded bar scene. I would not reccomend this place for families at all! It can get pretty loud here. Good beer, ok food!"
One,"Suppose to be a dive sports bar. If ur a metal or hard rock fan and try to play music on the jukebox,the owner has instructed the staff to skip it. They allow, classic rock, rap and country..if the bar is going to treat the customers like that then maybe he needs to specify that he runs a ghetto ass bar. The fact that I was told that I couldnt listen to what was on the jukebox was baloney. My friends play darts for this bar. The owner is an ass. He lost several customers tonight. And the fact that it was also my birthday too made things worse. Wouldn't recommend this bar."
Three,"Phallic alert. Yes, everything in this place has some sexual connotations about it. From the butt lamps, boobs on the lobby walls, and f*ck me looking rooms, it screams sex. Oh ya, on a side note, check out the plastic chairs in the RedBar. If you look at the floor at just a right angle from the chair, the shadow looks like an erect penis. \n\nOkay, maybe I shouldn't drink so much Malibu here. But if someone else is buying, I'm not saying no. Drinks can be pretty pricey and the service is halfassed at best. And I'm not just talking their slutty outfits. \n\nPool can be fun if you're with a big group. There are always lots of strippers and slutty skanks walking around in high heels (yes, at the POOL) and douche bag dudes with fake tans and too much muscle. It's great for next day stories :)"
Three,"Once upon a time, I really enjoyed this place for pretty much anything I could think of. However, since their budget cuts a lot of things have changed. Namely hours and services. Just going in to get a brochure  was impossble recently. Than, I went for a $5 hair cut recently and while waiting, another women was attempting to print a court document. Of course, one has no control over the amount of pages in a court document. However, it was over the 10 page printing limit and she could not print it. I offered my printing quota to her but it still did not pan out for her. I felt really bad. They would not even allow me to pay for her to print.\n\nWhen it came to the hair cut, I came early and they started late. It was supposed to start at noon and I was one of the first, however, at 1230 they still had not started so I left.\n\nI asked questions they did not have answers to and find each time I go to be an increasingly frustrating experience. \n\nWhile the center is overall amazing, I find it discouraging how I continually encounter women that leave without help pr answers.\n\nI will do what I can to continue supporting this organization but I will not do so when I am on a time or financial crunch."
Three,"""Actually I give it 3.5 stars. After reading some good reviews on Yelp I took a friend to eat dinner here. The restaurant is in an unassuming building in an unassuming strip mall. I was encouraged, because some of best joints I've eaten in were hole in the walls. The decor was basic sushi bar and comfortable. When I go to a new place I order a few \control\"""" items just to see how they stack up against other restaurants. Ikura, saba and masago among other things. These items test the skill and freshness of the place. I was disappointed that they ran out of masago. We ordered a few other items and rolls for dinner. I did find an appetizer that was strange for a sushi place, it was lamb chops. I ordered some and they were good. The food here was good but, nothing stood out and wowed me. The service was very good and we did not have to wait long for anything. Overall The prices, food and restaurant was average Phoenix sushi fair."""""""
Four,"Cafe Boa is a small, classy restaurant tucked away in an unassuming strip mall in Ahwatukee.  They have a rather limited main menu, but typically 4 or 5 daily specials.  I went here on a quiet Monday night with some coworkers and it wasn't busy at all.  The service was prompt and friendly, although they did forget to put our appetizer order through.  I had a Hawaiian sunfish that was stuffed with Asiago cheese over a bed of fresh rice and steamed veggies... It was delicious and a very generous portion.  The waitress brought us a free dessert for the appetizer mix up, so we were very happy that they took care of us.  I will certainly be back to sample more of their specials."
Four,"Best description of this place would be Chick-fil-A play land meets Pump-It-Up.  My kids love this place.  They're moving and climbing non-stop whenever we are there, so I love it.  We had their birthday parties there about 6 months ago.  Overall, I think the kids had fun. The only downside to the birthday parties is that you can't have a private party unless you do it afterhours, which is sort of late for young kids.   I think its $9 for an open session.  My only other complaint is the quality and price of the food.  I think its Sam's Club food.  They charge $2.00 for a not so great hot dog.  Also, I think they need to vacuum more often; the floor appeared to be pretty dirty.  They say they vacuum everyday, but I'm not so sure about that."
Three,"Man. I'm torn about this place. Let's talk good stuff first: It's convenient, it's close to everything. I love their zipparitas in every flavor, they often have great deals on food and drinks. It's a great place for watching sporting games. \n\nI mean it all sounds great, right? Everything you'd want in a sports bar. Well listen up, about 80% of the servers there are just straight twats. The customer service blows big ones. Idk why they've even got attitude, some of them aren't even cute. Check yourself girlfriend. I get it, you're busy. But we're your customers, get that bitchy look off your face. Enough with that rant, aside from their god awful customer service - some of their items are mediocre at best. They charge you for every side of ranch. Oh wait, you're not making enough money off all the drinks we have there, you need $.25 for the ranch too? It's a pet peeve of mine. Don't charge extra for condiments! \n\nSad thing is even tho I get so frustrated with this place, I'll still come here and tolerate their rude servers because sometimes you get lucky and there's a new server who isn't jaded like the rest of those B's. And those damn zipparitas. I love 'em. Sooner or later, I'll give up on this place for good."
Three,"Hanny's has potential - AZ/88 is one of my favorite places in town.  The building, design, and decor at Hanny's are amazing.  The menu and service, not so much.\n\nI'm pretty sure it was our waiter's first night serving tables - many awkward uncomfortable moments.  I ordered a $5 martini and received a half full martini glass.  Next time I will ask if I can order two at the same time and just pour them in the same glass.\n\nWe ordered the bruschetta appetizer.  The topping came in a bowl with some thin dry strips of bread around it.  The topping itself was tasty - my recommendation is for the Hanny's chef to take a trip to Postino and check out their bruschetta bread - thick and soft with crusty edges.  I found the dinner menu to be lacking in choices.  Nothing really looked good so I ordered a pizza which left me underwhelmed.  Soggy and flavorless.  \n\nMy suggestion to Hanny's is to think about the successful AZ/88 combination of good simple meals combined with strong fancy drinks.  Get somebody who knows how to make an Italian style wood oven pizza with crisp burnt edges.  And I don't think anybody will mind if a few of the menu items are the same as at AZ - in particular some good burgers.\n\nGood luck with the changes - the debt service on that building must be enormous, and I would hate to see it shut down.\n\n***UPDATE***  Been back several times since initial review - Pizza was much better (i.e. crispy) and the $5 martinis have grown on me - two drinks at AZ88 and I need a cab - not so at Hanny's.  I would still like to see some more options on the menu, though."
Five,"I remember first going to Sun Camera when I was a freshman in high school.\nEager to start my first photography class ever, I bought a Minolta X-700 SLR....still continuing with my passion for photography, today I shoot mostly digital, but I still (when I feel like shooting film) use that camera.\n\nThe employees here are all extremely helpful and really nice. I come here every so often still to get my Ilford B&W 400 speed film. They have a decent selection of films and a pretty vast selection of cameras for those who are looking to buy new or used. \n\nI love this shop."
Three,"We only had breakfast/ brunch at the Morning Glory, so i can't comment on any other feature of the Farm\n\n- Cute place; looks like a small, family-run farm\n- loads of picnic tables (and as we were driving out around 11a, we noticed a long line of cars parked along the gravel) \n- the setting would be great for baby and wedding showers, great for groups \n\nFood:\nI had the Gourmet  Wild Mushroom Omelet with a side of sausage\n- Home fries and Biscuit were a 3*\n- Omelet was ok, with a too-thick hollandaise sauce; 2.5* at best\n- Sausages were awful; really dry and cold\n- Coffee was lukewarm; not very tasty\n\nEveryone else's food looked pretty good, including the benedicts and tacos."
Four,"Me and Cerreta's have got some history. Probably because I grew up in Glendale, which is filled with boring suburbs of cookie cutter homes surrounded by six foot concrete security gates that house dysfunctional 2.5 kiddo families and promote a sense of community as deep as a valley girl's vocabulary.\n\nSo any time we visited cutesy pootsy downtown Glendale it was a memorable experience.\n\nI've toured the factory multiple times and regardless of age, childlike glee paints the face of every person in the tour group. You'll be thrilled by chocolate rivers, marshmallow clouds, edible buttercups and small orange creatures with violent green hair and a penchant for bursting into songs that have afterschool special messages tacked onto the end. Well not really, but it's as close to Willy Wonka as you're getting here in the Valley.\n\nFree tours on the half hour and sampling to your heart's content! Try the rectangular green ones. They're mint truffles and arguably the best I've had. Eat it Andes!! But I'm biased. I grew up with Cerreta. I stole their individually wrapped chocolates from the bins at Bashas. I went to high school with their daughter Candy--who's as sweet as her namesake. I'm a die hard fan of these home grown chocolatiers, and there isn't any other place I'd rather go to rekindle a bit of childhood nostalgia.\n\nIt's good family fun, a great date idea, or a nice distraction for the babysitters/aunties/grandmas out there (cuz you'll want to give the kids back right after they o'd on sugar).\n\nYou do get an unlabeled grab bag when you purchase a mixture of chocolates, but just channel the ingenuity of the young. Poke a hole in the bottom of each one with your finger. Viola! Problem solved!"
Four,"Great place, always stop in when I am in town.  They have a wood oven and cook most everything in it.   I love the Italian beef on skewers with vegetables that they do in the oven.  Pizza,  and deserts are great.  Salads are very good and a meal in themselves.  One desert, and I have never had it, is huge and obscene, but looks great (it is also done in the wood oven).  Excellent Italian wine list.  I don't know the deal with the prior owners but the Italian guy I meet who I believe owns the place now is very nice.  Big soccer fan.  Waite staff is very friendly."
Two,"I went over here to try the breakfast burrito's, but it appears that they don't make you a fresh burrito every time you order. I just wanted eggs and beans and cheese, the $1.99, but they were out of eggs? They weren't actually out of eggs, they were out of the tray of eggs for the burrito. They had eggs with sausage and bologna, but I don't like those meats and they appeared to have done some serious time in the pan since opening time. I prefer places that cracxk the eggs, but I suppose too many people show up here to go that route. Ended up with the two tamale special and rice for $3.50. Tamales, which were cheese and jalapeno's, were kinda dry and average quality. Doubt they were homemade. Best part of this meal for me was the Horchata, which was definetly homemade and had great hints of vanilla and cinnamon. I will also give props to tasty green and red salsa (chile?) that you can put on food or free chips. Mexican cookies are also good there, but breakfast burros were my reason for visit and that didn't cut the mustard."
One,"What a way to treat a client who has paid for services & recommended your shop to others. I recommend that anyone who is looking for a professional artist to pass on The Lady Luck. You know how they got the name? Well your Lucky if Tony keeps his appointment. The co-owner of this shop has no regard for your time or efforts on your part to keep an appointment. Artsy-Fartsy Cats never get this, regardless of how you dress or how cool your shop looks, be professional and keep your appointments & treat your paying, repeat clients with respect. No Bueno.\n\n\nFor one to say that Tony's art is bad is ludicrous. The Cat has talent and that I don't dispute. What's at question is the poor business practices. Noted that Tony is booked in advance, that's why I was their on time for a appointment that I booked a month prior. Yes, I walked out the shop & returned to work only after sitting in the lobby for over one hour past my appointment time. As for you Kris, you know where to find me, be sure to shoot up on Testosterone if you plan to Cupcake."
One,"""Seriously, when is it going to be over?  That is what was going through my mind during my 60 minutes of torture.  I must have gotten the heavy breather that the other reviewer complained about. Not only did he breathe heavily, but he grunted a lot, and seemed to stumble over his own feet. It was the most odd, non-relaxing, and miserable \massage\"""" experience I have ever had. It wasn't so much a massage as it was pinching, karate chopping (not even kidding), and holding hands with my feet.  Some things were bizarre, and borderline creepy:  picking up my legs and dropping them back onto the ottoman, pulling his fingers through my hair (curly hair with lotion on his hands), and the technique used to massage my thumb; it creeps me out thinking about it.  I don't know what I am going to tell my friend about my experience after she raved about this place; I'm embarrassed for her. I know typically you get what you pay for, but in this case it wasn't even massage worthy if it had been free! Since this was my first experience here, I will not be going back or recommend them."""""""
Four,"Still a solid 4 stars in my book.\n\nOrdered hot and sour soup last night and it was just OK. It was very brothy, and not as dark as most hot and sour soups. I suppose when thinking of my health, this is a great thing, but it just lacked in consistancy and the flavor was a bit odd. It had a great little kick to it, which you don't often find in hot and sour soups--so good job in that regard."
Five,"""Liqueur or Ice Cream?  What?! I don't have to decide which one to have, it comes together AND I can try any of the flavors BEFORE I buy my cup...well, ok, if you say so!

Friends of mine had one with vodka which one of them kept saying \ I can't taste the vodka!\""""However, this is the same person, who has had two apple vodka drinks and kept saying it was just apple juice not drinks therefore, Lee's is doing something right with the vodka in the ice creams!

Three,"Tried this place for the first time yesterday. I had the pork taco and the fish taco. The tacos range from $1-1.50, they are the tiny shell tacos like you see with street vendors. The pork is diced small and the flavor was delicious. The fish taco was good, but mine wasn't to die for. The shells in either taco were not heated. Liked the homemade salsas that accompany the tacos. The owner and his staff were very friendly. My brother had the carne asada burrito and really enjoyed the flavor. He also ordered the tamale but was not very impressed with that. Not much meat and small. The prices are great. We fed 3 people w/canned cokes for $12! If I'm ever in the area again, I will definitely go back to try other items, but won't make another special trip. All in all, a good experience! It's a small place with about 6-7 tables. At 4pm on Saturday it was busy, the patio didn't have any seating out there. Wouldn't recommend large groups unless you're doing takeout."
Four,"""Although I have been to Native New Yorker several times, before tonight's visit I read each of the reviews here before going.  I was surprised how lukewarm they were, I have always had a positive experience at NNY previously.\n\nToday's visit had some extra meaning for me, though.  I had just returned from Buffalo and only a few days ago ate many of the local foods that have made Buffalo famous, including Duff's wings and beef on weck at Blackthorn.  As these are the Holy Grail of these two Buffalo traditions I did not dare to compare a franchised chain restaurant in the middle of the desert to what many regard as the best of the best.  But yet, since this place dubs themselves Native New Yorker I felt I had to hold them to some sort of standard.\n\nReading the reviews it seems the consensus is that most people think the food is okay but the service is terrible.  Here's my experience ...\n\nWe walked in, early evening on a Sunday.  The place had a comfortable number of patrons; just enough to feel at home here.  The greeter was friendly and found a good table for us immediately.  Within a minute or so our server came over and was friendly, knowledgeable and kept the welcome feeling going.  She was on-spot recommending the Long Island Iced Tea at only $3, and it turned out to be quite tasty, not anywhere near as over sweet as some places serve it.\n\nI had to do the beef on weck and hot wings comparison and my dining companion followed along.  The wings were served in a reasonable amount of time after we were able to enjoy a few sips of our drinks.  How do they compare to the Gold Standard at Duff's?  Not bad.  The positives were they were a bit crispy and not drowned in hot sauce like they were spaghetti.  The not-so-positives were that they had very little meat on them and varied too much from one wing to another (every wing at Duff's is large, plump and meaty and they are all of substantial size).  At Duff's, they claim that their \medium\"""" sauce is most other place's \""""hot\"""" and I found that to be true.  At NNY their \""""hot\"""" is what I would call \""""mild\"""" by Buffalo standards.  Okay but certainly not hot.\n\nThe beef on weck was served in a timely manner and it looked pretty good.  I tasted some beef by itself and it had a nice taste to it.  The bun is mostly authentic, although it is too soft compared to what the Blackthorn in Buffalo makes in their own kitchen.  The horseradish is KILLER!  One of the hottest I have ever tasted.  Kudos, this is the first place that actually made me sweat a little over the horseradish and grab a gulp of water.   NNY cheats a little by serving some au jus with the sandwich (Blackthorn does not) which really makes it a French Dip, but if that's what people want, that's okay with me.  The accompanying steak fries are tasty and while I am not a big potato eater, I ate more than I would normally have.\n\nNot only was the Long Island Iced Tea CHEAP but the beef on week was about the same price as you would pay almost anywhere in Buffalo ... under $9 per serving.  The entire meal for two, with drinks was under $30.  That's a deal.\n\nBack to the server for a second ... the table next to us had the \""""customer from hades\"""".  If I had been the server I probably would have thrown the meal in his face and quit on the spot.  Our server had the patience of Job, however, and did an awesome job dealing with the completely unreasonable.  She's the reason I added a star to this review.  I'm not sure what some of the other reviewers expected but I think Native New Yorker hits pretty close to some of the legendary Buffalo icons in both food and service."""""""

Four,"Out of all of the Flo's locations, this is the one I've frequented the most over the past 3 years of living in the Valley.  I've seen the menu change here and there, but I have to say, I've never had a bad meal at Flo's.\n\nI met my friend Melanie H for dinner this evening and we really enjoyed our meal... we had great service - our waters stayed filled throughout the time we were there, and our food was served promptly. Our server checked on us several times as well.  We started with vegetable pot stickers and requested that they come steamed.  They were delicious! Next, we shared 'Indian Curry Vegetables' (I ordered it with shrimp) and Indian Vindaloo Chicken.  Both were extremely tasty - fresh veggies, chicken, and shrimp in really flavorful sauces with just the right amount of spice.  The curry vegetable dish came with broccoli, mushrooms, carrots, snow peas, and long beans.  The chicken dish had tomatoes and onions. We also had steamed white rice.\n\nNote to Flo: We were both disappointed that you took the Vietnamese Spring Rolls off of the menu and I miss the days of the green curry dish with calamari. One more thing - the chicken corn soup that you serve at the DC Ranch location should be offered at the others as well - I love that soup!\n\nFortune cookies came along with the check and we both were happy with our fortunes.  The bill didn't break the bank either.  See you again soon, Flo!"
Three,"I never made it to The Vegetarian House and decided to try this location again once Loving Hut took over the space. \n\nWe went on a Friday night, the space was clean and white if not a bit to stark (adjusting the lighting would work). The food was similar to the other dishes I have had at other Loving Hut locations so at least it was consistent.\n\nThe only problem I saw was the service. Everyone seemed to be trying hard and remained friendly while at the same time appearing very scatter brained. We noticed people flagging down waitresses as soon as we sat down so we knew something was aloof. It just seemed to be that they didn't have everything together, like it was opening week or something. Things took awhile and you could see the frantic pace to which everyone was trying to get things done, yet the restaurant was a 1/4 full.\n\nMaybe they will iron out some of they service issues, the food is still good although the menu is a bit tired - or I may just be tired of it. I should be thrilled with another vegan restaurant in the valley, but the more I sample vegan cuisine outside of Phoenix the more I crave more of that here."
Four,"zTejas is a good compromise for people who like quasi-authentic southwestern fare and those who don't.  Someone who doesn't want any southwestern flavor at all could go with the hamburger, chicken sandwich (hold the jalapeno mayo), or caesar salad.  I usually  have the vegetable quesadillas, chile relleno, or achiote chicken salad. Just steer clear of the Red Chile and Mango Steak Salad.   I rarely eat beef but I know what it's supposed to taste like, and this stuff was dried out and tough and gross.  I love that they offer Little Larry margaritas (smaller, cheaper, and less intoxicating than the regular size).  The food and service have been pretty consistent here and it's kinda nice not to have to deal with Fashion Square."
Four,"WOW!  This place is kind of expensive, but it is good food, great atmosphere and just plain fun.  We went there for my g/f's bday and we had a blast.  The sauces that they give you when you start eating your meats and veggies are sooooo good.  The drinks were not that expensive from what I could tell...I paid $5 for a beer...which is not too bad.  So if you want to go somewhere for a special occasion, then you can't go wrong here.  Just remember to figure, it'll be about $100 per couple..."
Five,"""This place is a must-visit if you are ever passing through the Cave Creek, Carefree area.  It's a biker bar first and foremost so that should be enough of a clue to most of you about many things including service, attitudes, decor, and of course motorcycle gazing.\n\nWe always hit this when down in Scottsdale and they never dissapoint.  They have a great staff serving tasty burgers and awesome pizzas made to order.  Wash it all down with a frosty beer then sit back and people watch. \n\nIt's been fun to watch them grow from a \shed\"""" to having a huge new wood deck with misters (absolute requirement in July!) and outside mini bar.

Five,"The coffee is smooth and delicious, not to mention delicately brewed and roasted on site. The staff is always friendly eager to help you to make an informed decision about your drink, and I have yet to get a smug look from any of them when I feign ignorance about any drinks. That little test tells me an awful lot about an establishment, and it goes without saying that, while Cartel is a coffee connoisseur's delight, it works just as well for those who might not have a handle on the finer details of this art. \n\nIf there's anything to complain about this fine establishment, it's that there's always a crowd, lending it to being a less than ideal setting to sit and relax, due to a dearth in seating. But if you can find a spot to plop down, you're in perhaps the finest coffee establishment in all of Arizona. That's not an exaggeration."
Four,"""The food was great. I get the Yupha's Fried Rice or the Pad Thai.\nMy girlfriend gets the curry.\n\nThey ask you how spicy on a scale of 1-10.

Five,"I have to start this review by saying I've been in love with Buca for years and years.  Back before they got bought out, I used to go all the time, but once they took my favorite dish (macaroni rosa) off the menu I got sad and now I don't go as often.  However, they sent me an email a week ago saying they'd brought back some old favorites.  Guess what was on that list?  Yep, you guessed it, Macaroni Rosa!!  Needless to say I have been twice in the last 2 weeks.  It's almost as good as I remember it... although it does seem to have more garlic now.  They also brought back their best salad - the 1893 salad.  It has meats and cheeses in it and it's awesome.  My list of Buca favorites (besides the macaroni rosa) includes the chicken limone, chicken parm, ravioli with meat sauce, and green beans.  Go with a large group or expect lots of leftovers because everything is served family style.  Although, they do have a lunch menu now with individual portions and they are never busy at lunch time.  Join their eclub - they'll send you coupons, which make the bill easier to stomach.  Bottom line - their food is fantastic.  If money grew on trees I could eat here every day."
Four,"""Another winner for Ahwatukee!  \n\nThis morning I had to run to the grocery store to pick a few things and decided to get some major points with the BF by bringing home a breakfast burrito!

It should be around 9 by the time I'm done at the store.\n\nSo I take my time browsing the grocery aisles to ensure a 9 am departure.  Walk in the door of Los Taquitos at 9:00 exactly and am successful in getting order #1 for the day!\n\nChorizo and potato for him, tacos for me.

Needless to say, I found a new group of buds to hang with.  I can do 'po all by mah self.\nPiles of food.

Four,"Some people may call this place in incomplete.. the hand painted signage on the windows that some use on their cars, the  patio tables for seating inside.. the empty feel it has. I, however, think it was on purpose. Some way, somehow, it causes instant relaxation. The brightly colored walls combined with the patio furniture really did calm me down and allow us to enjoy a two hour conversation without ever being pushed to leave. Hell, we didn't even get our bill until the wonderful Matt C. asked if we could pay. I've been wanting to get to this place for ages, but just never found the right time or occasion. It happened to be perfect earlier this week for dinner with a friend after I was picked up from the airport. \n\nThe food description Matt C. described is accurate so I'll elaborate on other points. The menu, which we both took pictures of once we saw Goat Curry listed, is small and interesting. It leaves me wanting to come back, and yes, next time, I will be getting the goat curry. I'm sure you are all lining up to come with for my 2nd visit now. \n\nI had the jerk chicken with rice, plantains, and a side of vegetable (I had two to choose from - steamed eggplant or bok choy). It was very delicious. The rice was slightly dry and not very flavorful, and wasn't my favorite, but it was a nice addition to the jerk chicken, which had some decent spice to it, actually probably a little more than the curry from what I remember. \n\nThe plantains, oh the sweet plantains were PHE NOM IN AL!!!!!! Well worth it.  In addition we had a side of roti for the curry order and it was some delicious bread. Probably the best bread I've had aside form nan. Why do other countries make bread so much better than us? Is it because we all try to swear ourselves off of carbs?\n\nTo drink, I had pink ting. I know, not surprising. It was a carbonated pink grapefruit beverage using Jamaican pink grapefruit, bottled in Jamaica, but a product of Canada. That made me giggle, but it was delicious. And, well, the name itself makes it worthy.\n\nOverall, this place was reasonably priced, and allowed us to enjoy our meal slowly, and talk for hours afterwards. The staff is truly genuine. If you're in the area, I'd definitely stop here. \n\nThe food is a 3, but the atmosphere is a 4, and I'm giving A Taste of the Caribbean benefit of the doubt."
Two,"""It's simply amazing how you can take a restaurant that has pretty good food, decent ambiance, and have the service people knock the rating from a four star to a two, but indeed, it happened tonight, and it happened at Stingray.\n\nMy work buddy and I went to Stingray for the first time tonight.  The drinks?  Good.  The tuna rolls?  Very good.  The sashimi?  Excellent (though the portions were small and the saba portions ridiculously small.  I don't get that.)  So the food was decent.  Nothing to write home about.  Now, about the waitress and the busboy?  Obnoxious--as in \over the top.\""""  If you read my other reviews you know I try to keep it positive and upbeat and I \""""try\"""" for humorous, but when there's a problem, I say so.  So, onto Ms. Obnoxious.  My waitress, Jane (or so it says on my receipt) felt it was completely appropriate to interrupt our conversation six distinct and separate times, to ask us how we were doing and to see if we would order something else.  No \""""excuse me,\"""" no politely waiting for a sentence to finish.  Just bam, in your face.  Rude.  Just the fact that I got to the point where I was preoccupied enough by it to start counting ... well peeps, speechless over here.  Take a hike, Jane.  Jane had absolutely no consideration for the fact we were the customer and the she was intruding, and let me make this clear if you are reading this, Jane.  You were extremely invasive.  Tone it down.  Simply obnoxious.  \n\nNext, (again mid-conversation) someone else comes over to lower the parasol over our head.  This, as I came to find out, is anything but a trivial process.  It takes five+ minutes.  As I repeatedly ducked he narrowly missed my head head with the metal support to the parasol two or three times. I couldn't help wondering two things:  a) does this really have to happen now?  and b) what special gifts from above have landed on that parasol throughout the day that are now in my sushi?  Are you kidding me?  We're eating here, dude!.   \n\nAnd then there's the busboy, which as well-intentioned as I assume he was, was hell-bent on reaching between us to grab dishes, some of which had not been used yet. Wow.  All in all MAXIMUS inturruptus.  \n\nNow--to sum up ... no need to send sympathy cards.  My friend and I managed to have a wonderful time because it's what we do, and despite what were well in excess of a dozen individual and significant interruptions we had fun.   It's about the people you chose to hang with.  But back to Jane et al, I mean seriously, people, you gotta chill.  If for no other reason, think of your dwindling tip potential!  Next time I will take my order to go.  Just proved to me how over the years I have mellowed out, because a few years ago I have had the manager at my table.  \n\nTo the people who visited our table tonight:  I hope you are never in a restaurant and receive the service we received while visiting yours."""""""
Three,"Litos is not bad.  Definitely not the best green chile burritos you will ever have.  For the bombest green chile burritos everyone who is in the know goes to Ritos down on Garfield in the hood.  However, in a pinch Litos will do just fine.  Someone told me they were relatives of the owners of Ritos and paid to use their recipes.  I don't know whether this is true or not so take it with a grain of salt.  Either way, their green chile burritos are a little pricey but definitely not lacking on flavor and better than average."
Two,"Took the drive out to Phoenix hoping I'd finally find some great Mexican food. Unfortunately I was disappointed. I ordered a chorizo, egg, potato & bean Burrito. I gave that a 6/10. What killed it for me was the cleanliness of the restaurant. Dirty tables, salsa spilled on the floor & tables. Plus they said they had horchata...it was one of those OLE fountain drinks. I was shocked. Seriously if you can't make your own agua frescas, I can't trust you to make me Mexican food. I lived in California for 24years, 15min away from Mexicali, Mexico. I know Mexican food & this ain't it for me."
Two,"""The front entrance at Padre's Modern Mexican is really one of the most unique and inviting entrances I've experienced in Phoenix. The use of glass and wood are truly lovely.* \n\nThat said, Padre's appeals to the lowest common denominator of the hip hop crowd that patronize this restaurant on Sunday afternoons. With a $5 cover, one would think there would be more of a draw than good music and a periodically tight crowd. Unfortunately, the music is where it begins and ends with Padre's. \n\nSome years ago we ate at Padre's and found the food to be quite good. I don't know what happened in the interim. For a restaurant that is first and foremost a place to get food, and also serves alcohol, to be serving their foodstuff on paper plates is disastrous. Yeah, I understand that you'll be saving a lot of water not having to wash all those plates, but that's something I expected at a bar that serves food as an afterthought--not the other way around. And if a restaurant has a waitstaff, one can reasonably expect an amicable staff with at least an iota of attentiveness towards their clientele. Nope, not here. I do understand that the younger crowd wasn't raised to appreciate waitstaff and probably don't tip, so I kind of understand why you'd rather try to get in some girl's pants than take three consecutive orders. Perhaps you, dear server, are better suited to working in an environment that doesn't require such distractions as doing one's job. And one might mistakenly presume that a restaurant would put its reputation on the line with the food that is served. Not the case at Padre's, whose view of \modern\"""" is fast at the expense of flavor. Don't serve me rancid cheese on a stale tortilla and expect me to not be ticked off. I really don't give a hoot that it only costs $2.95; the cover should help absorb the phenomenal cost of serving edible food. Don't even get me started on a Mexican restaurant running out of Pacifico. Really? That's like any number of bars in the Valley running out of Bud Light. I won't tolerate it there, and I certainly won't accept that here. \n\nThe next time I want to hear good hip hop music, feel crowded in my seat and eat sub-par Mexican food, I'll strap on my Walkman, tune it to 98.3, hop on my bike and ride it through the drive through at Taco Bell, because this trip sucked. It sucked! \n\n* One star because my mother taught me if I don't have something nice to say, don't say anything at all. Another star for the good music and company."""""""
Four,"Let me first say that this thai restaurant was definitely something that came as a surprise. As I was looking for a fulfilling meal on a friday night after work this definitely did the trick. The two ladies that work the front of the restaurant are super nice and helpful. I had the red curry with tofu and returned 2 days later for more, so yes it was just that good. I got the mild flavor which had a bite but the medium would also be a choice. I love how they make the curry overall it seems like it takes much preparation and doesn't consist just of a powdered curry. Overall, very clean doesn't smell like those weird restaurants that you aren't sure what comes out of the back and definitely reminds me of back home in Los Angeles. If you have time you should definitely check on the marketplace next door, it is quite the cultural experience with some exciting treats. I will definitely be back and will be trying their pad thai."
Two,"My wife enjoyed her meal, but I'm pretty picky when I experience the same style of food that I've had before, YC's in particular. After being seated, we grabbed our bowls and headed towards the food line. There were three rows of food and condiments. The third row was a little difficult to get to. None of the employees were paying attention to the food. You could see where people had gotten something and it spilled onto the edge of another container of food. The setup was totally inefficient. The selections were so-so. I was surprised that we could only order our noodles or rice at the end. For noodles, they used soba noodles which are a lot thicker than YC's and THEY control the portion. WHERE's THE NOODLES!! And that is one reason out of several, why I won't be back."
Four,"""Don Guido's is Sunnyslope's hot dog place.  I'm not especially a hot dog gal, but Don Guido's offers something else to Sunnyslope too: Italian Beef sandwiches! \n\nThis was my lunch today: a delicious Italian beef sandwich paired with garlic fries! The beef in my sandwich was not fatty or metallic colored like I've experienced in other places. I really enjoyed it and will definitely have it again (but will probably ask for it a little more wet, next time)! \n\nBut, seriously, let me tell you about those fries...!!! Don Guido's garlic fries exceeded my expectations!! The fries were nice and crisp, not greasy. And, while I expected a shake of garlic salt to qualify for \garlic fries,\"""" I was delighted to find them topped with REAL minced garlic and parsley. A lot of it too! People were coming into my office from down the hall to get in on the action! \n\nWe've polished them off, so you'll have to make a run to Don Guido's and get your own. TOTALLY worth the trip!"""""""
Two,"I have been coming to Orange Table on and off for about 5 years.  I've always found the coffee really great and the vibe of the place is very cool.  I also like the location, it is close to the library and a beautiful park that makes it a fun place to start out a morning.  This place has so much potential, that I'm so sad that I get disappointed in some fashion on every visit lately.  At some point, about 4 years ago, the service was actually decent.  We would come with our young children, sit on the patio, enjoy a great cup of Joe and get our food pretty fast.  They have slowly and consistently declined.    The servers have always been nice, but we haven't seen one in the past several years that appeared to have any experience being a server.  The last two visits we had to sit about 5 minutes after we had our food served, before we actually had silverware to eat it.  There is ALWAYS at least one item forgotten.  Ordering something extra or trying to get an order corrected usually requires walking up to the counter (about 10 feet away) to get someones attention if you didn't notice the problem when the food was dropped off.   One thing I have learned is to ask for the check as soon as you get your last bit of food, or else you will end up sitting at a table with empty plates for a long while before they realize you are done.  \n\nI probably will not be going back for a long while.  I will give them another chance sometime in the future to see if anything has changed.  Why?  I love the location and I enjoy sitting out on the patio.  It is easy to bike to if you live in the area and the civic center mall area really has a nice atmosphere.  The coffee is good.  I do like most of the menu items and I have never received anything that was bad.  The food isn't anything to write home about, which makes the prices a little hard to justify, but it is consistently adequate. Most of the time it isn't super crowded.  Certain times in the mid morning you might end up waiting, but most of the time you can get right in and seated.  If you are not in a hurry, want some decent coffee, and can put up with laid back service that sometime borders on criminal, then this place might just be for you."
Five,"The food and service was awesome!!! Our waitress was Desiree. Being our first time here, we took her recommendations. Excellent choices. The hummus was smooth, creamy, and flavored just right. Best ever! The bread is homemade and perfect alone or with the hummus. The Dana Sis (grilled lamb cubes, rice, and vegetables) was something I'd recommend. The lamb cubes were generously sized, seasoned and grill perfectly. Moist and packed with flavor...not gamey. Went perfectly with the seasoned rice and shredded veggies. Portion was large enough for two. They have several deserts. We got the baklava. They had several kinds. We got two of the four choices. Definitely made with butter and so good. Not overly sweet. Went perfect with their Turkish tea. Every dish seemed to have a secret ingredient..I know because I asked. The service was timely, friendly, and educational. It  was an excellent first time experience.  Never been to Turkey, but I know I'll love the food and people. Price was reasonable. With the food portions so large and delicious I don't know how all the staff stay so slim."
Four,"I brought my boyfriend here for his birthday dinner around New Years, and we had an excellent experience. Good service and amazing food. I'm not usually a huge oyster fan but since it was J's birthday, we ordered oysters as an appetizer. Let me tell you. Best decision EVER. These were, by far, the most amazing oysters I've ever eaten. Order them, it will be the best decision you'll make that day.\nI had the bone-in filet which was, of course, delicious and perfect. The bf ordered Chilean Sea Bass because it was recommended by our server over his other choice of rack of lamb. I personally would always choose a steak because this is a steakhouse but he wanted something different. The sea bass was good, but not as amazing as he wanted it to be. But like I said, it's a steakhouse, you should order steak. Nonetheless, I'm fairly certain he enjoyed his meal. We also had the Lobster Mashed Potatoes which is definitely worth ordering - buttery, with large chunks of lobster, and just melt in your mouth goodness. Note that the side serving is generous, so one side is probably more than plenty for 2 people, especially if you've ordered an appetizer; between the two of us, we had a good amount of leftovers for snacking on another day. (The mashed potatoes were a lovely pre-dinner snack on New Years Day while we were recovering.)\n\nThe one negative I have to say is that I have eaten at other Maestro's that I feel have a bit of a nicer ambience - or maybe we just came on a particularly busy evening - it was loud and felt very crowded. Even though our table had plenty of room, I still felt fairly squashed. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed the food, and would return here for another special occasion. I just don't expect a super intimate setting - cozy and dark, yes, but with the addition of lots of chatter from the bar, which to me, changes the ambience.\n\nTip: Reservations are a must for busy nights - and try to be as punctual as possible. We were running late and they said they would only hold our table for an additional 15 minutes."
Four,"If you like spicy food, this is one of the best places in Phoenix to find it.  I was taken here by some Taiwanese classmates, and enjoy every trip I make.  It's not conveniently located, but worth the trip.\n\nIf you can find a Chinese speaking/reading person to bring with you, you will be able to order some of the specials and things that are only written in Mandarin.  \n\nThere are two menus, the smaller menu with more Americanized fare, and the larger menu with more authentic Chinese cuisine.  If you are into the American side of things, their food is what you would expect."
Five,"Absolutely the best pizza in the country!  This is no doubt at the top of my list of best restaurants and experiences in the country period.  I've eaten pizza all over the country, the top in New Haven, New York and Chicago and even in Italy and Bianco is still the best.  The pizza is unique in the chewy and crispiness plus the hand picked farm fresh ingredients and flavors that will throw your mouth and tongue into doing the tango with each bite.  I always laugh when people tell me they can't imagine waiting 2 or 3 hours to get a pizza.  I've been here probably a hundred times over the last 10 years and it's worth the wait every time.  Why?  It's a great place to wind down and enjoy the fantastic staff, the colloquialish environment and sip wine or beers with friends.  Our modern day everything now, instant delivery, always on society leaves much to be desired in real connection and honest experiences that life is truly all about.  Diving into the Pizzeria Bianco experience with the intention of establishing a delicious connection with Chris Bianco's brain child and allowing for a savory experience- an evening of un-rushed fulfillment is one of the best decisions one can make on any particular day in the valley of the sun, downtown Phoenix."
Three,"I would categorize this place as a glorified bar food type of place. They have sandwiches, salads, apps and drinks! \nI sipped a few bloody mary's since I hit the sauce the night before and they were so good. I usually don't order them or anything that isn't sparkling or straight up but they were fantastic and spicy!\nThe 'rents and I picked at this dip plate that was so fantastic just go try it. No words. \nThen I dove into the crab cake sandwich. Holy crap was that phenom. It's huge too (____'s what ____ said). I had the kale salad on the side and that was freaking awesome as well. \nNot to say that I didn't have high hopes for this place but as a Postino regular I wasn't dying to hit this place up. Now I'm dying to go back. \nI love the patio. It's like sitting in someones back yard. And who doesn't love a wall full of cassette tapes? What else is one to do with their collection? Loves!!!"
Five,"I was very impressed with Distrito! We were a party of 10 and made a reservation about a week in advance, and also did the $40/person menu which consisted of a few dishes per course. What I loved was that our servers asked if there were any food allergies - and my having developed a recent allergy to shellfish, I had no qualms letting them know. The chef made 2 dishes especially just for me! And I think they were 2 of the best! Highlights were the ceviche - non-shrimp - which had toasted sunflower seeds, pomegranate seeds, jicama, and a lime sorbet to top it off. They also brought the most delicious brisket with some BBQ sauce on the side when the shrimp skewers came out. So much amazing food - and the pitcher of margaritas was also fresh and fabulous! Overall we loved our dinner here - the service was friendly, prompt and attentive and I can't even begin to say how pleased I felt with my specially made dishes."
One,"The food is simple, pure and uncomplicated; you taste (and hopefully enjoy) each ingredient. However, as with most minimally processed cooked foods, it does not travel well.  So, eat in. Luckily the decor is modern and compliments the menu well which makes eating in a pleasure.   \n\nMy only down note is on the service. If you are not careful when you enter the restaurant, you may enter through the door of invisibility and will become invisible to the employees. As a result, you may stand at the counter while they work around you but do not recognize your presence until the invisibility dust (or whatever makes you invisible) wears off.  Based upon my late lunch experience today, the dust takes 4 iPhone e-mail responses or texts to be removed (10ish minutes). Regrettably, I only had three unanswered e-mails in my inbox and had to leave before I could be seen by the employees. On a positive note, when you leave (regardless of the time you waited), the invisibility dust seems to be removed. I know this as no one honked or screamed at my car as it drove away without a driver."
Four,"Great Sprint store with extraordinary customer service. Horrible location, though, being smack dab next to a high-traffic Chipotle, which seems to always be busy. \n\nI've come to this Sprint store twice now for customer service issues. No, there wasn't anything wrong with my phone or my plan. In fact, the first time I stopped in was to address my battery issue. I couldn't keep a charge. The guy behind the counter exchanged my old battery for a new one - at no cost. Then he said he'd knock $5 off my text fees - something about a special promotion I was eligible for.  Very cool. \n\nMy second visit was to activate a new phone and change my plan to the new Everything Plan. What a cinch! I was in and out in under 10 minutes. Could it really be that simple? Yes, I guess so. \n\nSay what you will about Sprint, but I'm stickin' to this carrier, especially if they offer a new coverage plan with unlimited messaging (including text, picture mail, web access, etc.) WITHOUT demanding I extend my contract. Plus, my phone works everywhere I travel. I really can't say the same for Altell, T-Mobile or Verizon. (And I simply refuse to use AT&T for reasons that'll remain confidential.) \n\n*steps off soapbox*\n\nSo, yeah, anyway. Got a Sprint or Nextel phone? Bookmark this location. It's not one in which you can get your phone repaired (you'll have to go elsewhere for that) but for anything else, this is the store I recommend."
Three,"Big...really big. \nYou know when you think it's a good idea to take a connecting Southwest flight out of here because you figure it will be ok making the switch? No, not necessarily true. A flight can bring you to an A gate and you have to board in a B gate-doesn't mean they're anywhere close to each other.\n\nBTW-I appreciate the many opportunities for shopping while waiting in the terminal, and the vaiety of food options if you don't mind fast food.\n\nI get confused where to meet my friends for pick up. South side if you're Sassy; North side if you're Naughty...yes, my friends are silly. The cab line is long and twisty, and weird, and ugh....just take a shuttle."
One,"I would give it less if I could.  I have been here once before about 6 or 7 years ago.  At that time I thought I wouldn't be back, it was dirty and smelt weird and the food wasn't good.  Well a long time has passed and we went for a friends birthday.  We ordered apps and waited for a while for those. They where decent not great but decent.  Next comes the food.  The waiter sets the food in front of me and on my plate of chicken parm there is a plastic bag with pasta and sauce in it.  The bag is marked Sunday and it was Wednesday.  I looked at it, laughed a little to myself then pointed it out to the rest of the table. \n\nWe flagged down the waiter and showed him the plate. He took it back grumbled something and walked away with it.  Came back out 2 minutes later with the pasta dumped out of the bag onto my plate.  Being it was my friends birthday I didn't want to complain too much so I ate some of my chicken and didn't touch the pasta (in hind sight I shouldn't have eaten anything).  My husband wasn't happy with what happened and flagged down the waiter on my behalf to ask him how old the pasta was. We wanted to know if it was good until Sunday or was it made on Sunday and are now serving it on Wednesday. The waiter started talking about him being and pharmacy tech or something like that and didn't answer the question.  So my husband asked to talk to the manager.\n\nThe Manager comes back to the table about 15 minutes after we asked to talk to him and after everyone else is done eating.  He came up defensive and making excuses about company policy. They make pasta 2 times a week and portion it in little bags add sauce and microwave.  It isn't like I expect to have great fresh food at a place like Rainforest Cafe but pasta 4 days old? It isn't like it is hard to cook or takes a long time.  Needless to say I will never ever go to the restaurant again. I am glad what I did eat didn't make me sick.\n\nAfter my experience I checked the board of health sight and it is scary!!  http://www.maricopa.gov/envsvc/envwebapp/tabs/results.aspx?navigatedFrom=businessResultsDrillDown&mc_perm_id=51696&business=RAINFOREST%20CAFE&address=5000%20%20%20ARIZONA%20MILLS%20CIR&permitid=SG31025 \n\n\nThink  twice before going to this place."
Five,"Noble Beast is great.  The owners are really nice and always seem to do their best to be personable, even when they are busy.\n\nThe prices are reasonable, they always have cute toys and other little gifty items for your pets, and they really participate in the community - especially in trying to find homes for pets in need.\n\nDefinitely worth checking out.  Also, they carry a line of dog food that is truly the very best, and it's made here in Arizona.  It's called Azmira.  Our dog eats it and she is totally lean and healthy."
Four,"It's about time I write a review for Malee's!  After all, I've been more times than I can count... in addition to the Yelp event (which was fantastic), I've been to Malee's in large groups, small groups, and solo.  I've also done take-out various times including tonight!  \n\nI love the Desert Ridge location because they have sushi in addition to a really large thai menu.  It's great because you can order edamame, seaweed salad, or sushi appetizers and then get a thai entree... or you can get a thai appetizer and sushi dinner.  (I'm a big fan of mixing and matching!)  I also like that Malee's is open to substitutions in dishes if necessary.  Some of my favorite thai appetizers are the siamese kisses and summer rolls.  I also enjoy the pad thai, and all of the vegetarian options.\n\nAs of tonight, I have a new favorite dish at Malee's... the thai basil curry clam house special.  It's a mouthful, but it's awesome!  I ordered it with medium spice and had them add veggies.  Wow.  Phenomenal!  I was happy it came with rice (your choice of white or brown) because I sopped up the broth with the rice... and I have to admit, I thought about drinking the extra broth too - it was that good!\n\nService is usually great and everyone is friendly at Malee's.  By far the BEST thai food in the area, and the best restaurant in the Desert Ridge shopping mall.  The only suggestions I have are these:  please add an eggplant entree or at least allow me to add eggplant to the dish I choose to order, and perhaps a thai garden salad with peanut dressing.  Other than that, Malee's rocks and still supports my theory that I was thai in a past life.  See you again soon, Malee's!"

One,"""When the increasingly creepy chef-owner Jeff Smedstad lost his half of the restaurant in a divorce, we had hopes that this place might actually serve normal food. Jeff's penchant had been to offer cutesy specials which were all presentation and no substance and sneer at anyone who dared to order from the menu. Sad to say, things have gone from worse to \worser\"""". Mystery meat abounds. Strips of chicken skin fill the rolled-up items. It as if this is a convenient way to get rid of the garbage rather than having it hauled off. The food ranged from barely acceptable to disgusting. \n\nIt's a tiny place in the Pep Boys parking lot, housed in what used to be a veterinary clinic (no joke). So perhaps that's why the cuisine is reminiscent of something made out of the day's losers at Turf paradise. Margaritas taste like antifreeze unless you order the super premiums which won't leave any money left for ordering food and that may be a good choice. Portions are small and overpriced  but if you get there before the Pep Boys garage closes you can dine to the sound of air wrenches and tire machines. Ah, so romantic. \n\nA true godawful experience."""""""
Five,"Nirvana for the home chef...I LOVE THIS PLACE!\n\nLike most retail establishments, you won't usually find eBay-esque prices, but I love the great selection of products, including high-end stuff that I don't see anywhere else.  And I have actually found some great deals on de Meyere and de Buyer cookware - even cheaper than eBay.\n\nThe friendly staff generally knows what they're talking about, and I appreciated being able to try out a Shun Ken Onion knife before buying.  The lady said, 'Hold on a second...' and disappeared to the back.  When she returned, she had a handful of carrots for me to dice.  Nice!\n\nI still enjoy perusing W - S, too, but Sur la Table blows it away.\n\nPS:  their book signings are great, too.  Met Steven Raichlen a few weeks back..."
Four,"So many haters of buffalo exchange. I enjoy shopping here. Yes sometimes I will go three or four times and come up completely empty handed but when I find a quality shirt or pair of jeans it is all worth it. I especially love when I bring in the crap I wore like ten years ago praying they will accept something, but they never do. Its the look on the face of the clerk and the disdain I feel when they judge me for what I wore in 1998 that makes me feel alive."
Two,"I've passed this place for years and years and always appreciated the old-school appearance--similar to all of those Chinese places I grew up with. The other day we finally got around to trying it.\n\nI was not expecting genuine Chinese food, on the contrary, I was expecting old-school, Chinese-American stuff like chop-suey. In that, I was not disappointed. With a couple of exceptions, their menu could have come out of a Chinese restaurant in the Midwest circa 1970. \n\nI was, however, disappointed with the food, sadly. This is one of those places I was anxious to like--a real throwback and a survivor. But truly, the food was not good. In fact, my egg foo young tasted a little spoiled. I threw it away and ate the friend won tons they gave us. The rest of the food, according to my family, was not that bad, but nothing great. Even the spicy dishes tasted rather bland. \n\nI do love the look of the place, and the service was friendly and efficient. I hate to give it a two star review, but I can't muster any more than that right now."
Four,"Went to this location last week - was nervous to go because although I love waffles, and fried chicken, the idea of eating them together freaked me out.  But my husband is a huge fan, so I decided to suck it up.  I'm glad I did... Although I typically prefer my waffles a little crispier than LoLo's makes them, the flavor was to die for!!!  And who doesn't love some delicious fried chicken!  I know I do.... Try it!  You'll love it!"
Five,"OMG, try the Peach Beer ladies, you'll be ordering beer all night, for the TASTE for once!!!!  We were visiting from SoCal for Spring Training and the hotel clerk recommended this place.  It was just a 15 minute drive from our hotel.  The food was amazing, the beers are great.  The service was great.  We had to wait a little while for seating, but it was worth the wait.  Food came out almost immediately, but not over or under done.  They must know what they are doing in that kitchen!!!!!!  \n\nI will definitely eat here again when we are back for Spring Training next year!  GOOOOO DODGERS!!!!"
Five,"I really enjoyed this restaurant while on vacation this Summer!  My family had its reunion in Phoenix and this was the location of our banquet.  We had a private banquet area outside where we were able to have a fashion show, dancing etc.  Now to the meal, we had a whole half of a chicken, a whole steak, corn on the cobb, baked beans, bread and cake! And it was all delicious.  It's a shame the amount of food that was probably wasted because people were getting steak and chicken just because they could.  If I'm ever in Arizona again I will definitely be back.  There was also a live bull outside!"
Five,"""The Good:\n1. One of, if not the most aesthetically great looking ballparks in the country with beautiful mountain views. \n2.  Excellent food options such as Asian, Mexican, and your typical \ballpark\"""" fare. I highly recommend the Crust Pizza a local pizzeria who have a stand here.\n3. Tons of parking and shuttle service to and from old town Scottsdale.\n4. Intimate feel\n5. Casino nearby for post game entertainment. \n6. There are NO bad seats in the house. \n7. It is quite literally the Disneyland of baseball with easy access to practice fields and players.\n8. Free sun tan lotion.\n9. The facility has 3 party decks. (Pepsi Patio, Coors and Miller decks)\n10. Local favorite and former D-Back Luis Gonzalez is usually here and hangs out with the fans. \n11. Has more intimacy than Chase Field, the D-Backs regular season home.\n\nThe Bad:\n1. Lack of vegetarian foods.\n2. Feels like a regular season stadium with regards to the size of the building and the prices.\n3. It can be a long walk from the parking lots to the stadium unless you manage to park very close. \n4. Unlike other spring training parks outside food is NOT allowed."""""""
One,"""I tried. \n\nI really did. I really wanted this to be \my watch guy\"""" for repair and servicing.\n\nAfter reading all of the amazing reviews about 'The Watch Repair Company' I decided to bring in a few of my old watches with the hope of giving them new life. I brought in older Seiko chronograph that needed a battery, cleaning, and some scratches buffed out. I also brought my Skagen World GMT watch that needed a crown replacement, battery, and cleaning along with my Vostok-Europe Anchar that needed the rotating bezel pin replaced or fixed (to keep the bezel from falling off).\n\nI was certain this was going to be the beginning of a wonderful business relationship. After all, the owner is Russian, one of my watches is Russian, and I even spent some time in Russia, so I knew a little about Russian watches and culture. Gosh this would be great I thought. \n\nBoy was I wrong. \n\nStrike One: \nAfter dropping off the Seiko and Skagen for what I thought would be a pretty quick fix and clean up (the owner tells me this), I get a call a week later stating that the Seiko is ready but he would need more time to fix the crown on the Skagen. \n\n\""""Ok, sure. Let me know when it is ready.\"""" \n\nNo worries right? I'm not in THAT desperate of a rush to get the watches back. I can wait. About five days after that, he calls me to inform me that the Skagen is ready with the Seiko for pickup. \n\n\""""Bring cash, I don't take Visa.\""""\n\nSure. No problem. His business, his rules. I get it. Well, I pick up the Seiko and Skagen to see that yes, they are fixed, but he did not clean or polish them AT ALL and they were both really dirty still. \n\n\""""Maybe he just got busy and forgot?\"""" \n\nAnyway, while I'm waiting to pick them up there were also several other people (shady looking folks selling gold, and selling it FAST) making deals with him so I felt like mentioning it my \""""cleaning problem\"""" would not have not warranted a good response at that moment. So I figured I would mention it another time, or just clean them myself as I am more than capable. No biggie. \n\nStrike two: \nA few days later I I decide to give him another go as he mentioned to me that he was an expert in Russian watches. So in good faith (once again) I bring him my Vostok-Europe Anchar, and ask him to fix the bezel. he gives me a \""""range\"""" for a price and so I drop it off. He wasn't sure if he had the parts and said he may have to send it \""""to a friend\"""" to get it fixed. \n\n\""""Ok. Just let me know when it's ready\"""". \n\nA couple days later he calls me to tell me that maybe I need to call the distributer (only a couple in the U.S) and have the parts paid for, and shipped out here so he can fix it. So to recap, a Russian watch \""""expert\"""" who is now asking me to do the leg work and get the parts needed to repair the watch. Hmmm. At this point I decide not to invest any more time into this, as I can now see where this whole thing is going. I decline politely opting to send the watch to RI for repair instead.  \n\nStrike three: \nA few days after the Vostok fiasco I somehow rationalize with myself that the reason he couldn't fix it was because of the rarity of the watch itself and that i should just stick to \""""easier\"""" repairs for him. \n\n\""""Man, I'm trying so hard to give this guy my business it is unreal\"""" -This what I was thinking at this point. \n\nI give him a call and ask about crystal replacement for my Skagen. Why not? Surely he's got this under control right? \n\n\""""Yes, bring it in. I replace with same crystal, $30.00 cash\"""". \n\n\""""Great. See you Thursday\""""! \n\nNot so great when I visit him though. He takes one look at it and tells me he cannot fix it because the crystal is \""""too big\"""". Mind you, he had an extensive amount of time with this watch (I presume) because he had it for close to two weeks when he repaired it the first time. Ugh. \n\nHere is the deal. I am patience to my own detriment sometimes, I am aware of this. Therefore sometimes I get treated a little poorer by businesses that think I won't do or say anything. I get it. But I really wanted this to by \""""my watch guy\"""" and I was trying so hard to give him my business even after he fell through twice on his end. What else could I do? \n\nHere is my actual evaluation of his operation:\n\nGot a quartz watch in need of battery? \nSee this guy. \n\nGot ANYTHING of value that you want back in a specific time frame? \nGo to an AD. \n\nGot a watch over $100 with repairs needed? \nGo to another shop or send it off to an AD or highly recommended place. \n\nGot gold for sell? \nSee this guy for quick cash (it seemed like a popular choice when I was there). \n\nSorry, I tried. Guess I'll have to take my business elsewhere. \n\nOne other quick note. The whole \""""desperate people selling gold and ONLY dealing in cash\"""" made me think that this guy's operation of watch repair may be a front for his other dealings. Not saying I care, just saying it came across like that to me as I was waiting for my watches."""""""
Five,"I am hands down obsessed with this place. Best pizza in town. Better than Grimaldi's, even! I will say that both times I have been there, my order was taken completely wrong, however, it did no phase me becasuse their pizza is worth it. The calamari is amazing as well. And the veggie salad with the white beans. I have only had these three things every time I havee been there! I just can't stray because they are so good :)"

One,"""Extremely disappointed in this location.  The manager Tiffany Rodriguez treats her employees horrid.  She runs the entire staff through FEAR. I thought Chipotle was a forwarding thinking company by having free ranged meats ect.  But, what I have found out is the manager is incompetent, mean, intolerant and plays with the employees lives using Fear and Manipulation. Tiffany should be fired from this company and my next step is to write a letter to corporate office and include all documentation of the events that have accrued to many of the employees working at this location.  I used to love Chipotle and used to love the taste of the food.  NOW - Chipotle has left a BAD taste in my mouth.  \Food with Integrity\"""" is their mission.  Integrity is honoring the \""""Whole\"""" meaning the animals who give theirs lives to feed us and more importantly the employees who serve this food.  Tiffany Rodriguez is a very, very, very bad example of integrity. As a business owner myself I would clean house at this location and the first one to be removed would be the fear based, manipulative abusive manager named Tiffany Rodriguez. \n\nWord of Mouth is your best advertisement and I will no longer support this company until I know this manager is retrained or fired.  More importantly, if this is how all Chipotle managers operate then Chipotle is a fraud =  Food and service is a fraud.  \nBeware consumers...these employees at 16th and Camelback in Phoenix are working out of fear of loosing their jobs.  Sad, Sad, Sad - Chipotle should be ashamed.  Tiffany, my suggestion to you is go get some help, my dear. Karma is a bitch."""""""
Five,"Love love love this place!!!  From the decor to the delicious utilization of local food, this is a place that I highly recommend to everyone!  The Funghi pizza is heaven.  Goat cheese, mushrooms and truffle oil!? Yes!  We often come here for a full meal, but there have been more than a few times of coming just for the chocolate cake.  The owner comes into my job a lot and I asked him what was up with the chocolatey delight.  Apparently they spent three months working on the menu. Time well spent sir:)  We have tried a wide variety of their menu items and haven't been disappointed once.  Great wine at competitive prices, tasty house cocktails and a really fun use of space.  They even have a cute little garden outside.  Oh, and free valet!"
Two,"""I love love love consignment stores...and walking in this store, the smell was great...  however...\n\nI have to say i am disappointed with My Sister's Closet. I had heard such great things, so I was really excited to go. They did have some amazing designer purses, including a $3400 jimmy chu purse that was huge and gorgeous for $1899.  \n\nThe designer section clothing was hung on nice wooden hangers with their logo (Nice touch). \n\nHowever....... The items I saw around the store, and my friend with me agreed, seemed like more than 40% really were more appropriate for a thrift store, and a lot of the items were really dirty (and still had high prices). You could see food stains on a dooney bag.. a coach wristlet, black, had white food smeared all over it... still highly priced for as dirty as it is. The thing is... even if it is a brand.. sometimes your store reputation is worth more than the 10 bucks you'll make by selling something dirty. Just my .02. \n\nI saw sensors put though jeans pockets, wallets (in the leather!) and other questionable placements. When I asked about it.. the sales person just said, well maybe there is someone new who does not put it in the right place. That damages items people are buying, and they may not realize the big holes placed by those sensors. \n\nI loved there \on the web\"""" tags. I've never seen that before, but they are really pretty and catch your eye if you want to take a closer look. \n\nI prefer consignment stores to identify the sizes on the hanger by color coding or some such to make it easier to find my sizes. I get bored really fast trying to find my size..  As a consumer, I would have spent more time looking had I been able to really scan the racks easier for size.\n\nThe shoes are nicely organized.... and clearly labeled. They were not over crowded so it was easy to see the shoes. \n\nThere are some positives.. I purchased a le sportsac tiny bag for 9.99, it was new so i do feel it was a good deal.  but really be careful what you buy.. The prices for the purses seemed high for used resale and their obvious usage stains."""""""
One,"""I really wanted to like this place, since it's close to where I live.  Really, I did.  Unfortunately, it's just  not good.  My hubby ordered the Gyros Plate, and I ordered a Gyro sandwich.  Because we were extra hungry, we also ordered calamari appetizer and feta fries.  Nothing was good.  I mean, how can feta fries not be good?  I think they must use very cheap ingredients.  The lamb flavor was not good, and the calamari was rubbery.  Tzatziki sauce not good either.  I've had way better Greek food in crummy indoor malls.  So disappointing.  I don't know if I'd go back if you gave me a free meal there.  It would have to be a long time from now, when my memory has faded of the un-tasty meal we had.  Blech.\nJust told my hubby I was writing a review of Daphne's, and he said it wasn't worth it, \it's nasty!\""""  LOL."""""""
Two,"Terrible service. Arrived on a Tuesday night. My friend arrived before me and she waited to be helped when she walked in as she wasn't sure if she should seat herself or wait to be seated. The guy who appeared to be a manager (shorts and a baseball cap) walked by and ignored her twice before finally asking if she needed help. (The rest of our visit he did a whole lot of nothing standing on the patio. Wait, I take that back. I saw him pour one beer.) I arrive about 10 minutes later and join my friend who is sitting outside. She has a beer she ordered, and I wait for a waitress to come and take my order. She shows up about five minutes later,  I order a beer, and we place a food order. I sit waiting for my beer, and nothing. I look over to see our waitress talking to her fellow workers at the front of the restaurant. There are about four of them with a couple of them sitting on the counter by the front door. Thank goodness they don't serve food on that counter!  I wait a few more minutes, cutting her some slack, when I finally get up and walk inside. I ask her from the door if I can get my beer. They all look at me like I am a freakin alien or something. My waitress finally comes forward and I ask again if I can get my beer. She has a confused look on her face until it dawns on her that I ordered a beer. She repeats what I ordered and says she'll go get it. A couple of minutes later a different girl brings my beer. The food arrives and is fine. You can't really screw up a chicken sandwich and fried pickles. We were there a little over an hour and she checked on us once. (they weren't busy) So much for a second beer for me. We asked for the check, and it took 10 minutes for her to come back and collect  it. On top of her being a bad waitress, she had the personality of a door. Didn't smile once, and looked like she hated her job. Seriously doubt that I'll be back."
One,"""J and I were planning on attending this event.  Mainly because I had purchased a Groupon that got us 2 for the price of 1.  That and we have watched both seasons of F.T.R and love it!  Needless to say, we were pretty excited for this event. \n\nWe got to Indian Bend and the 101 around 10:00am.  Having never been to the ballpark before, I wasn't sure if I was heading in the right direction.  No sooner than I got to Pima, I start seeing the line of cars.   \n\nIt takes 30 minutes to finally get to a lot entrance.  I ask the guy standing at the entrance if there's expectant mother parking.  He says no, but that I'm free to park in the area where they're directing those with handicapped plates and placecards.  I thank him and drive over to the grassy knoll.  I don't even have a chance to put my truck into park before some guy comes running over telling me I cant park there.  I very strongly said, \Well I'm pregnant, and the gentleman right over there said that I could.\""""  He doesn't say another word.  The woman in the car next to me then said, \""""They'll end up giving you a ticket.\""""  I state that since this isn't technically handicapped parking - No signs that state HC only parking - They technically don't have the right.  I then remembered where I was and I didn't really feel like fooling around with tribal cops.   I throw the truck into reverse and get in the line to head to park with the rest of the cars.  \n\nWe finally get to the head of the parking line and next thing we know, we're being told parking is $5.  NO WHERE ON OUR WAY INTO THE LOT WE WERE PARKING IN DID IT STATE PARKING WAS $5!!!  We were livid.  No where on the event website did it state that parking was $5.  We pretty much yell this to the min. wage lot attendants.  AND - Where does SRPM get off charging people $5 to park in a f-ing DIRT LOT!?   $7 for parking for events at the State Fair location in Phoenix (which they have noted on their website)- to park on a paved lot.....Fine.  $5 to park on a f-ing dirt lot?  I told them where they could shove the car behind me's $5 and make a U-Turn to leave.  \n\nJ and I ended up going to breakfast instead - where we didn't have to pay to park.  \n\nFrom what I'm told, and from what I'm gathering with glancing at a few reviews - the Street Eats Festival was not worth it.  With long lines, and trucks running out of food.  I'm now kind of glad we bailed in the dirt lot."""""""
Four,"My first and only visit thus far was many, many moons ago as part of a large meetup group.  Many of us started to gather outside around 7p.  I arrived a little earlier since I planned on trying some BBQ at the stand located outside the venue.  The meat sampler I had was tasty, and it was easier to turn down the cornbread since it looked rather dry.  Instead, I said hello to a beautiful slice of peach cobbler :D  While I cannot eat raw peaches anymore (a pity really, since I only started eating fresh, not canned, peaches around 2 or 3 years ago and LOVE them!), I've found that cooked peaches are safer for me, which I am thankful for.  I recall thinking that the cobbler was good.  \n\nMusicians started to set up around 8, and the first band began playing at 9p.  I enjoyed the many bands that performed that night.  The acoustics of the room was very good considering the venue's history.  I did notice that the crowd here was an amalgam of various age groups, and everyone did seem to be having a lot of fun.  One downside I found was how busy the bar was, esp. since all I wanted was ice water.  Perhaps someone should install a bottled water vending machine."
Five,"In town for work, I booked my stay at this hotel without really knowing anything about it (other than it being a Hyatt, within my price range and within relatively close distance to my customer).  What a surprise as I pulled up - the grounds are GORGEOUS.  I felt like I was on vacation!!\n\nPalm trees in the driveway leading up to the hotel, live music in the lobby bar as I checked in.  I leaned over the balcony to see if there was a wedding or maybe a corporate event, but no!  It was just the lobby bar area with live musicians!  It was such a nice experience.\n\nThe room itself with very clean, very comfortable.  I slept like I've never slept in a hotel bed before, like a baby!\n\nI had sushi in the sushi restaurant within the hotel (I'll be honest, I found some other higher-rated sushi places on Yelp that were relatively close and I was planning on stepping out for dinner), but the music and general atmosphere was so cool, I decided to hang out and try the place inside.  I'm glad I did, the service was great and the sushi was very fresh.\n\nWhen the sushi chef mentioned the 10 interconnecting pools AND a slide, I felt cheated.  I need to come back here, when I don't have to work!!\n\nOverall, everyone I spoke with was super friendly and I honestly look forward to coming back!  I totally echo one of the previous reviewers comment about coming back to Scottsdale just to stay at this hotel, it's definitely on the list of to-do's!"
Three,"""It's always hard to magnanimously write a review for a business when you are not it's target audience; and much like a 48 year old construction worker reviewing \My Sister's Closet\"""", a 300 lb Sun Devil's line backer reviewing \""""Green\"""", or a elderly Mexican grandmother reviewing \""""The Rogue\"""" my impressions of Amsterdam are obviously going to be a little skewed toward my bias.\nHowever I will go ahead and say this, Amsterdam is a great social experiment. As if the people watching here wasnt enough, the sheer melting pot that is this club is remarkable. I've only been twice but each time the cast of colorful characters carousing their night away is ripe territory for a budding writer in search of amusement or inspiration. My first time I came here to meet up with an old group of friends, the minute I walked in the doors I saw nearly every character from Lou Reed's apochryphal and timeless song; a powerfully built tranny that towered above me in stature with a pink slip and heels on, a loud and foul mouthed Filipino diva m.c. in drag, crowds of cute women out for a \""""girl's night out\"""", buff dudes in t-shirts 2 sizes too small, a few burly ladies in cropped hair here and there, sad old lonely chicken hawks in salt n' pepper mustaches reeking of desperation, and then of course me and the other awkward straight guys not really sure why we're there. Each time I've been it's been packed, the music has blared and the drinks were stiff.\nLast Saturday was my second time here and it was...an interesting night to say the least! After hitting up the lost leaf and film bar, a group that consisted of one of my oldest and best Tempe friend's, my ex girlfriend and her room mate, a random girl my buddy had snagged from some hipster at FilmBar, and two lively dudes we met dancing their night away  at Amsterdam. we sat on the back porch shouting over one another and puffing away at cigarettes until near last call.\nAmsterdam is a solid option, and always a funny story the next day, I give a very solid 3 stars."""""""
Five,"Can I give more than five stars for something? If something deserves to be rewarded with six or more stars, it is the ability to get a hot dog and a soda for $1.61, after tax.\n\nThe corporation itself is commendable for quite a few reasons. They say that cashiers get paid $40k/ year plus benefits, which is nothing to shake a stick at. \n\nIt takes a small amount of consumer awareness to know what you can and cannot consume in the time before that product expires. Once you can effectively guage those habits, you're off and running and ready to reap the benefits. \n\nYou won't find cheaper booze in large quantities, or slices of pizza for under two bucks. The costs of membership are justified within the first month of shopping here, or atleast they were in my experience. \n\nI strongly recommend dropping by on weekends and sampling some of their newest goodies at one of the many free sample stands."
Two,"I've come here various times, with the service varying also.  I don't like the females work outfits of 'japanese' dresses either.\n\nthe late-nite sushi is the 1 thing this place has goin for them next to the trendiness.\n\nnever had any of the kitchen food, but the sushi has gotten progressively worse.  i had some toro one day that smelled and tasted really fishy and oily.... meaning it was old.  if you're cheap, u can sit in the bar, have drinx, and free rolls.  haven't been back since the toro incident.  i think sushi chefs should have a standard of what they serve, so i don't trust the judgment here.  \n\nif you like paying for atmosphere, go here.  u won't b paying 4 what the sushi is worth."
Four,"After two years of living less than 2 miles away from this place, I finally decided to stop in.  I'm glad I did... I love how low key it is, the selection of produce, the prices, and the older folks shopping are way more pleasant than those at that Fry's on Indian School and Miller (I don't go there unless I have to).\n\nIf you live close and you've never been, stop on by next time you need to go to the grocery store.  You'll probably like quite a bit over the Fry's, Safeway, and Bashas around the corner."
Four,"Cheap. Fast. Hearty. I am not a fan of the meal 'breakfast', but my brother and father love this place. You get so much food, for such a resonable price. Their breakfast burritos are amazing. You can mix and match any of their fillings. I like mine with cheddar, sausage, avacado, mushrooms and green chiles. Yummy!  The pancakes and biscuits and gravy are HUGE. Like I am not kidding, this place will fill you up & keep you full for 10 days. If you can finish an entire meal, you should win an award. Seriously."
Five,"I took my Dad to this restaurant hoping for a great meal.  We were not disappointed!  In fact, we chose this restaurant b/c of the raving reviews - all were correct - this is an AMAZING place to eat.  We were seated right away (despite the fact I muddled the online reservations), the host was very understanding and we were seated immediately.  The service is impeccable and the pork shoulder made me cry it was so tender.  We had churros for dessert - fantastic.  The churros were hot and came with an outstanding milkshake.  I will definitely go back - and bring family."
Five,"Absolutely the best dining experience I've had.  From the amazing staff and service to the delicious and beautiful food, I can see why it's the only 5-diamond rated restaurant in Arizona.  Don't get me wrong, you pay for the experience, but I believe it's worth the price (this coming from a very frugal person who tries to find discounts wherever she can).  \n\nMy husband brought me here for my birthday and from the moment we sat down, we were treated wonderfully.  We ordered the suckling pig torta as an appetizer (portions aren't huge, but extremely flavorful and definitely enough to satisfy).  The appetizer was great, as a matter of fact...my mouth is watering just thinking about it.  As entrees we ordered the lobster, scallop, and shrimp over squid ink pasta with gruyere cheese on top, and the buffalo tenderloin with mushrooms.  Both were amazing.  The lobster was no doubt the best dish I've ever had.  Everything was perfectly cooked and seasoned and deliciously rich but not heavy.  The buffalo was surprisingly not gamey and had a great fresh taste without being dry for such a lean cut of meat.  \n\nWe want to go back and try one of the tastings, but for 200 per person, we may need to wait for a bigger celebration to go.  But I'm already plotting the next time I'll be back for another mind blowing experience."
Three,"I desperately wanted to like the new Trader Vic's in Scottsdale.  \n\nThe old Trader Vic's restaurants were legendary in 20th Century tiki-Polynesian lore, and I was hoping that the new location would not only feature awesome food and drink, but also totally nail the oldschool tiki vibe with the right decor, vibe and music.\n\nAnd on most fronts, this place succeeded.  The interior and exterior was pretty awesome: more upscale and hip than kitsch.  The music wasn't old school exotica, but there was a circle of guys playing guitars and bongos in one of the exterior patios.  \n\nWe ordered a PuPu platter, which was quite expensive - if I remember, about 40 dollars or so.  And the servings were enough for one or two people.  Maybe I'm spoiled by most of these old tiki places that mostly serve bad Chinese food, but I was hoping for a little more in the food department.  \n\nHaving said that, all the food was good.  The drinks were decent, not as great as I was hoping.  Again, this is Trader Vic's.  Vic created the mai tai, and I wasn't all that much impressed with theirs.\n\nIt seems that a number of the new Trader Vic's locations (Scottsdale and Chicago) have since closed down, which is unfortunate.  While I wasn't completely won over on this place, I did appreciate it and was hoping to go back and give it another go in the future.  \n\nBon Voyage, Trader Vic's (Scottsdale)!"
Two,"""it's too much.  i get that they're trying to be a place where a variety of people with different tastes can all get together, but... the variety has gone too far.  i don't WANT a place where i can get coffee, breakfast, lunch, snack, beer, wine, study tables and live entertainment.  i want a place that does one to a few things WELL instead of doing a bunch of things mediocre.  \n\nit IS a great place to meet with people -- much more room to chat than most starbucks or other chains and you can spend a few bucks on a beverage instead of going to a restaurant and feeling like you need to scurry away when you're done eating.  But i don't even want to spend the money on the sub-par beverages.\n\nwhich brings me to the other \too much\"""".  the prices are way too high.  it's at least as expensive as starbucks (if not more for some things) and i still haven't found anything that i thought was delicious.  the safest thing to do is to order an iced tea -- i've never felt like sending it back, but the coffee is too weak and tastes a little.... off.   and the small is still 16oz -- too much.  \n\ni want to fall in love with this place and i've given it several  goes, but i just can't."""""""
Four,"Preface:  Today's review of AB is based on my meal ONLY!\n\nI had the turkey pastrami sandwich and fries.  It was a good sandwich loaded with turkey, slightly light on the pastrami spices, but still good.  The fries were cooked perfect.\n\nService was prompt and friendly.  Atmosphere is quite good, slightly loud but not bothersome unless you want complete silence.\n\nThey had Bluepoint Oysters that I wanted to try, but passed this time.\n\nThe other 2 folks at the table got fish and chips and both were displeased, commenting on how greasy and light on fish the meal was.  So maybe it is just their fish and chips that are bad??  So a tip may be to pass on this dish.\n\nSlightly expensive in general, but AB is still one of the better places downtown."
Five,"i have always loved  whole foods but this one tops them all as they have an amazing bar with at least 20 beers on tap- microbrews and imports. they have a beer class every friday at 7:00pm and james, the brewmaster, is super knowledgable and does an awesome job. they have mini restaurants in the store so you can eat while you drink. i look forward to my friday nights off so i can go, be educated, and have great beer!"
Four,"I thought it was time to update my review; it's been several months since I last raved about India Grill.\n\nIndia Grill has since become a favorite lunch time spot, the lunch buffet is just delish! The menu changes daily and I noticed on the daily specials, that on certain days employees of Free Scale and Honeywell get 2 bucks off their lunch, I think that's pretty neat, a company rewarding employees that go to their restaurant. \n\nToday I was craving the butter chicken and rice, I had been thinking about it all week and man it was perfect! Also out to try was Chile Chicken, that my friend was a very delish dish. Oh and let's not forget the garlic naan, that's some good stuff right there!\n\nIf you haven't been to India Grill, you should give them a try! Also if you check in on Yelp, you can get 10% off your bill!!"
Four,"""I'll go see movies like Iron Man, Thor, The Dark Knight and X-Men, but I am no fanboy and I did not spend much of my youth nor any of my adult life reading comic books. \n\nThat being said, now that my 8-year-old is really getting into reading and also enjoying playing his Lego Batman game on the Wii, I decided it was time to find him some books to learn more about Batman and the assorted villains he faces in the game. I remembered a Batman encyclopedia I had read as a kid at the library and went to see if anything similar still existed. \n\nThe workers at the store were very happy to show me what they have available and even give me other suggestions within the same type of reading level. \n\nI ended up getting a book entitled \Batman: The Ultimate Guide to the Dark Knight\"""" and a collection of Batman: Brave and the Bold comics from the youth section. \n\nMy son was excited with his birthday presents and I was very happy with the service I received at the store. Definitely recommended."""""""
Four,"Julio's Too is a great place to get your tex-mex fix quickly & satisfactorily. The menu is really big and there are a lot of vegetarian options. I give them a high rating because the veggie taco salad has to be one of the best I've ever had, and I've eaten a ton of taco salads. They put real romaine lettuce in it, a ton of freshly sauteed veggies, a light sprinkling of cheese, good black beans, and a nice healthy dollop of fresh & good guacamole. I also had a green corn tamale which was alright, but the sauce (which you have to pay extra for but is totally worth it) is amazing - it's flavorful, thick, comforting. The tamale itself seemed a little dry, mushy, and bland to me. I didn't really like the free chips (too thin) & their free salsa (boring flavor) didn't impress me much."
Four,"Spent 3 years in Phoenix trying to find a good Mexican restaurant that reminded me of my hometown in California. Let's just say finding this hidden gems was as close as it gets. The outside of the restaurant is a bit run down and could scare potential customers away. However, that is what gives it great character and makes for a great  place to stop by. The food is amazing and the customer service is excellent. Would recommend to anybody looking for authentic Mexican food."
Four,"I see a few of the previous reviews discussing issues with service, but I have always had good service at this place.  I have only been in a handful of times, but we never have to wait very long to be helped, and the staff is very friendly.\nI have only ordered salads there, but I've enjoyed the three that I've tried (Maggie's, Jamaican Jerk Chicken, and Greek).  The salad dressing always comes on the side, which is perfect, because that is how I like to order salads (so I can control the amount of dressing.)  My husband loves the pulled pork, although it's popular and sells out pretty quickly from our experience."
Four,"Let's see, $3.50 Absolut ($5.50 Grey Goose)....SOLD!!!! \n\nThis is a little gem of a dive bar where you can get your drink on HELLA cheap! I think the most expensive drink is the top shelf tequila for $6. The crowd is a mismash of old timers and interesting locals.\n\nI had a great time with some of my fellow yelpers as we were nearly intimidated into playing pool while another patron decided he wanted to kick my ass. The jury is still out on why, but it was fun speculating. \n\nOne of my favorite drinking scenarios is when I enter a bar with $20 and leave wasted with some change left. The Rite Inn delivered!"
Three,"There comes a time where every Yelper just have to set the record straight and get a lot of criticism for doing so... Now is that time for me and Z's Greek.\n\nZ's is a cool spot that looks a little gritty on the outside, but is warm and friendly on the inside. The staff is super friendly and I like that a lot! Overall, the restaurant has a great vibe about it.\n\nNow for the part you don't want to hear... I do not come to Z's for their gyros... Not at all. Calling their gyros the best in the valley urks me. It's just not true. \n\n***************************************************\n\nGyro Review:\n\nIn all honesty, it's just okay... The meat is decent and the tzatziki is good, but it doesn't make me crave Z's at all. Their gyro is served a bit differently than the traditional style in that is has a helping of lettuce added to the top of it. It's great for filler, but not so much for flavor. The best way I can describe it is that it's like eating a gyro salad on a pita. Another main component of Z's gyro that doesn't do much for it is their bread. The texture is just off for me. I wouldn't send anyone here telling them that they HAVE to try a Z's gyro.\n\n***************************************************\n\nIf you don't hate me yet and you're still reading, great! This is just my honest opinion, and plenty of others are thrilled when it comes to Z's gyro...just not me.\n\nIn contrast to their gyro, I will say that their falafels are quite good! I was pretty surprised. Their tahini is also pretty awesome (which is served with the falafels). And lastly, you SHOULD go to Z's if you love feta! They are the most generous with it! I love feta, and that's what's been keeping me a customer! A chicken pita with a side salad (more like feta salad topped with lettuce) can really hit the spot!\n\nGo to Z's to check it out, but don't go there with as high of an expectation for their gyro as I did."
Four,"""carne asada is really really good. i like it best in the burrito form. i rarely enjoy any beef dishes at mexican joints. usually, its chewy, tasteless and greasy. the carne asada here is none of those things. i love the pastor tacos as well. just like \tacos and beer\"""" taco shop in acapulco. the only thing i wished is that the pastor had a better crust on it. it is supposed to spin on the spit like a gyro and have a crunch to it, but it really doesn't. its worth getting the chips and salsa. the staff is very friendly."""""""
Four,Every employee that we interacted with was extremely friendly and outgoing and get this..... SMILING! who does that anymore???  Anyways-  they all were really fun and made our dining experience so much more comfortable than other snobby places in Scottsdale.  For example: Bungalow Bar and Grill.  I LITERALLY walked into the place and greeted the employees... Isn't that THEIR job?? Ok- I'm getting off topic.  PEARL sushi is good sushi for a tolerable price and has great employees that look happy to be there. SHOUT OUT to our server/bartender Christina Lee.  That girl was so funny!!
Three,"There were ample pool tables which was nice but the sitting tables were seriously garbage. The seating was horrible and I felt like I was gonna fall every second. Also they were unnecessarily close to eachother. \n\nThe prices were alright for bar food. Nothing too special on pitchers of beer. \n\nThe food was SO good. Like, I was really surprised. Usually bar food is only tolerable. (even at some of my favorite sports bars)  But everything we ordered was extraordinary. It was restaurant quality and worth the price.\n\nAs for the atmosphere, it'll keep me from going here again. Absolutely FULL to the brim with college pukes. If you don't know what a college puke is, I suggest you walk around Mill Ave from 6pm-11pm. You'll soon find out. Not my thing, but some people might love it. (college pukes)"
Five,"Visiting from Chicago we found Hula's on YELP.  It completely lived up to the reviews!  We will be back on our next trip.\n\nFood - simply delicious.  Close to anything we've ever ordered in Maui.  I had the butter fish crusted in macadamia nuts.  Fabulous.  The mango chutney topping was the bomb.  Great flavors and combinations going on.\n\nDrinks - excellent.  Well poured, mixed and delivered with love.  Staff - very helpful with recommendations and had a great sense of humor.  Ambiance - sit outsdie.  Awesome patio area with firepit-perfect for a cool February night.\n\nWill recommend to all who visit from Chicago."
Three,"Came here with a couple friends, one of whom recommended it. We went during early lunch hours on a weekday so we had the place to ourselves. The waitress was friendly and offered good service. I ordered the mushroom burger which was actually pretty good (really rich beef flavor), but not worth 12 dollars in my opinion. The fries were nothing special and at 5 dollars, disappointing. Its challenging to escape a bill less than 20 dollars.. and for a lunch spot I think that is pretty high. I probably won't be coming back ."
Five,"""I'm in love with Yogurtland... you don't even know.\n\nIt seems like I keep going through fads (ice cream to gelato to frozen yogurt), but I hope this one sticks at least a bit longer than the rest.  The place itself is self-help soft-serve yogurt in a bevy of flavors that change out regularly, however, there's always a no-sugar added flavor available.  Personally, I love the NSA Strawberry Banana and the regular Green Tea flavors.  For toppings, they have all kinds of fresh fruit, cookie crumbles, sprinkles and other traditional frozen yogurt \condiments\"""".  \n\nThe interior design is clean and simple and they have ice-cold water available in the seating area.  I consider Mojo this place's primary competitor since the space and idea are essentially the same, but Yogurtland with it's new location near Old Town and the fact that it's cheaper ($0.30 vs $0.39 per ounce) make it my go-to frozen yogurt place.\n\nGo at least once.  Just do it."""""""
Four,"Now, finding this place was a bit tricky.\n\nThis was a pit stop on the way to Cali from Texas.\n\nThe owner is SUPER nice and they have two menus, which if you are Asian, you know what I mean.\n\nI ordered soup and a cup of soup is much larger than what I am used to. I was verrrry happy about that.\n\nThe square it's located in had a quince store (store specifically for quincinera dresses) and some place (I will assume) sells TVs/used electronics.\n\nThe prices are reasonable, portions are large- def family style and when the brothers asked for the Vietnamese equivalent of Chinese dishes (bc they only know the Vietnamese name and not the Chinese), the lady not only understood but was able to suggest dishes, if she didn't have the exact dish. The brothers also knew some basic Chinese (food, mainly lol) so that helped.\n\nThe owner speaks English, so no fear if you are not a native Chinese speaker.\n\nThe neighborhood looks sketchy, lock your stuff up tight in the car.\n\nYou can order take away, too."
Five,"Wow!  I have experienced some wonderful Thai joints in my life, but this is one of the best.  First, the food.  It is tremendous and the clarity of flavor is amazing.  I have been trying to work my way through the menu for several months now, but always seem to come back to the short rib panang (panang neur).  The short rib is always moist and lean and the curry has just the right amount of heat.  Order it, you will not be disappointed!  In addition, you can't go wrong with the pad ke mao (spicy skirt steak with wide noodles) or the pad se ew (noodles with pork).  They also have numerous vegetarian options, if that is your particular flavor.  I have not quite made it away from the proteins.  \n\nI understand that they have a fairly decent happy hour, although I haven't had an opportunity to experience it yet.   \n\nOn to the decor.  Sandwiched in between boutiques in Gainey Village the owners had their job ahead of them.  I understand that Wendall Burnette was the designer (who also designed St. Francis Place in central Phoenix), and the minimalism definitely comes through.  The place looks great, but it is not what I would necessarily describe as comfortable. Perhaps as the restaurant gets broken in it will soften a bit. \n \nThe service - I have visited the restaurant four of five times and have no complaints.  The servers are more than happy to assist with any questions regarding the menu and will definitely give you recommendations based upon your own personal preferences. All you have to do is ask."
Three,"Came mid-day for drinks and apps after a hike in Papago Park. Got Irish nachos and was very pleased with them -- potatoes cut up like slightly thick chips and not just served as french fries like many Irish-like bars. \n\nOur server was quite nice and brought out samples of different brews so we wouldn't feel stuck with something we might not like while trying something new. We didn't ask her to, she just did it. That was pretty cool. \n\nWhile I do agree that the uniforms are somewhat cheesy, I think it's silly that people are complaining about them. The girls chose to work there, just as you chose to eat there. If you don't like it stay away from Hooters, Heart Attack Grill, the Grill Next Door and Tilted Kilt.\n\nNow I was a bit irked by the price, however. Irish nachos and two pints came out to $19. Jebus."
Four,"Meatlover's paradise! I've been to a few Brazilian steakhouses but I was really impressed with both the service and the food. If you go, GO HUNGRY!!! I know you're supposed to go there for the meat but the fried bananas and the cheesy bread puffs are sooo amazingly good, I have a hard time staying away from those. After working my way through a wide variety of meats, I left in a meat stupor. The meat, by the way was delicious. Quite a big variety of meats, cuts and they were all flavored really well. The service is really fast."
Four,This place is not that easy to find but I'm glad I hung in there and found it because I really liked it.\n\nStopped in for lunch last week to try something new. When I walked in I was immediately greeted. The man behind the counter asked if I had been in before and when I said no gave me several recommendations. He also told me the make all their mayos and sauces there. A big plus in my book. I decided to try the Vermonter with a side of pasta salad.\n\nThe sandwich was plenty big and the bread was fresh (always important). The turkey and ham were tasty and the sliced apple was a nice touch. It was a little light on the cranberry mayo though. The couple bites I had where I could taste it I thought it was really good - would have loved more!\n\nThe pasta salad hada good flavor but the noodles were either undercooked or dried out. Kinda seemed dried out. They were a little hard for pasta salad IMO.\n\nThey have a few tables inside but more tables outside which was great since the weather was nice. Could get a little crowded inside in the summer.\n\nOverall I really liked this place and now that I know how to find it I would go back.
Three,"I feel like I had to opposite experience of most people who reviewed this place.  Service wise, my experience was great; the waitresses were very attentive and helpful, and the women I presume to be the owner was very friendly.  That, coupled with everything that has come up about the quality of the food, I was excited.\n\nThe food? Meh.  I got a turkey melt, and the bacon on it was so dry that it was literally hard to eat.  I ended up disassembling the second half and just eating it in parts.  There were roasted red peppers on it, but I forgot they were even on it until I saw the few there were on it.  I also had the greek side salad; nice assortment of greens, but I didn't think the caper vinagrette tasted like capers, and some of the greens on the bottom were wilted to the point of being mushy,\n\nMaybe I ordered the one weak thing on the menu, there seems to be plenty of fans.  I think I'll be going back for drinks, but not food."
Three,"""Prices are fair. It WREAKED of sewage outside on the patio area. So we sat inside.  I ordered the BBQ chicken and my fella ordered the BBQ burger.  Both arrived with virtually NO bbq sauce. I requested some twice from our server until I walked up to get my own at the checkout area.\nAlso, \flash frying\"""" perfectly delicious veggies simply to have them delivered to my table dripping in oil and flavored in lonely salts was a waste of a few bucks.\n\nStep it up"""""""
Four,"Here's the thing, if you like hanging out with college age kids and watching girls dance on bars, then you'll love the Library.  \n\nIt's actually not a bad spot to hang out at- it can be pretty fun, but it obviously attracts more guys than girls.  But when the servers are outfitted in tiny school girl costumes, what do you expect?\n\nBut other than that, the Library plays good music and the drinks are decently priced.\n\nThey are open for lunch too and have a good happy hour. Plus, they're located on Mill, so you can always hit up a few different bars if you get tired of this one."
Three,"I am 1 for 2 at Lamp. The first time I went, I sat at the counter had quick service and great food. So, I decided to bring my wife and daughter with me and the encounter was less than memorable. Yes, the food was good, but the service was... really awful. It was 7:30 pm on a weekday night and a light crowd (save for a table of six nearby whose noise was deafening). With many empty tables, we were seated in the corner next to the restrooms and the rather loud diners who lingered long after the bill came. But, hey, that's their prerogative.\nThe food was good but we were greeted by two servers--one plus a trainee. There were long gaps in service during which our apathetic servers vanished or chatted with other diners. Our salad order was delivered incorrectly and all of our food pretty much came at once. And then our service pair vanished again. My wife had to go to the front of the house to get a box and our bill as to not prolong our stay.\nLamp is in a spot that has had quite a bit of turnover in a shopping center that resembles a modern day ghost town. I was pleased after my first visit to see a new, exciting dining establishment come to our neighborhood. They best fix their service issues or be the next in line to come and go from North Pima Road."
Five,"We ate at Eliana's based on reviews we had read.  Since we had to be at Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport anyway, and, Eliana's was not far from the airport, we decided to have lunch.  It was wonderful and we highly recommend it.  Everyone was very friendly and the food was delicious.  There were 3 of us and we each had something different.  Every dish was fresh and flavorful.  The juice drinks (I wish I could remember the names) were very good.  We will definitely go back."
Three,"""Quick Note:\nIf you are looking for a upscale \instant noodle\"""", then this is the place. I should add the ramen served is not really instant noodle, but closely resembles one. If you are looking for a true ramen place, this is not it and if you are a purist-who-complains-a-LOT, stay away! I recommend it to most otherwise.\n\nThe Food:\nFortunately, the range of additional toppings is pretty good, but every little bit adds up. The total for my order of Spicy Ramen +Egg +Chashu +Vege Paste +Garlic Paste +Chili Paste and a regular drink adds up to $17.27!!!\n\nThe soup is what resembles instant noodle the most. It taste like plenty of MSG in it, but is so delicious, I finished it anyways. \n\nThe Place:\nThe place looks even more spacious due to it's open design. Definitely a hipster vs foodie place. There is a bar/restaurant combo on one side and a regular restaurant on the other side.\n\nDa Service:\nThis place is pretty much self-service except when they bring the food to you. You order it at the counter. They give you a placard on a holder with a number for delivery to table. Condiments and utensils are near the soda machine.\n\nUltimately: \nNot too bad. Not excellent. A good place for students, which seems like the bulk of their customers anyways. Unless you are overly critical over ramen, add this place to the list of backup restaurants especially on a cold day (but this is AZland!)."""""""
Three,"""Came into town for the Phoenix Rock N Roll Half Marathon, and was lookin' for some pretty good eats for my  post-run.\n\nI checked out Yelp for some Mexican food down the street, though the place ended up being closed on Sundays. Decided to walk the town, and saw some Mexican food along the way, but got turned off by the ones that seemed like a \loud bar first; food second\"""". \n\nGot close to the end of Old Town; the choices were slim; yet nothing screamed at me. The only two left were the sandwich shop (next door), and the Daily Dose Grill. The crowds and outdoor seating here caught my eye, and even though I was starving, decided to muster up the energy to wait.\n\nThe restaurant was crowded with a buzz, yet not too loud, subtly lit in a good way, and had good energy. Being solo though, I was quickly seated at the bar, where I could sit, and take in the football game on TV.\n\nThe bartender was perky, and took my order. I ordered the - \n\nGreen Chili Chicken Enchiladas - Hand shredded chicken stewed in green chili sauce, rolled in a southwest tortilla & topped with cheddar cheese. at 9.95 \n\nNote - I ordered extra cheese - with additional avocado.\n\nThe food wait, though, was about 40 minutes; the gentleman sitting next to me had been waiting even way longer, and by the time his chicken nachos came, I almost grabbed a few!\n\nMine finally arrived. For what it was, the meal was actually pretty good. The chicken tasted tender, hot,  and fresh, and they gave me a decent amount of avocado.\n\nIt wasn't quite what I expected, though. When they say \""""enchilada\"""", I'm expecting something a little bit more cheesy, saucy, and perhaps baked a little bit. This tasted more like a chicken wrap. Though the chicken was shredded, moist, and slow-cooked, it tasted more lke a chicken wrapped in tortilla, with a little green chile sauce added.\n\nLike I said, though, for what it was, it was pretty good. The gentleman next to me actually complained about the wait time, and got a discount off of his check! I should've gone that route...\n\nThe food, ambience, and the uinqueness of this place warrants coming here again, though because of the service, and my expectation, they get only three (rather than four) stars."""""""
Four,"There aren't a lot of places around here that are open past 10 pm but this chain is.  So one evening when I was out late and had eaten a late lunch and wasn't hungry at a normal dinner time, I stopped in here after 11-ish for a bite. \n\n I got a Foot Long Chili Dog special for $2.99 (with onions), a small Tater Tots,  a small cherry slushie, and a small coffee to save and reheat in my motel room the next mornig.  That cheap hot dog was delicious. The Tater Tots were freakin' awesome!  And I don't even like Tater Tots.  But these were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside with just enough oil to help it crunch with a wonderful texture.\n\n I got my cholesterol and calories and sodium quotients  in for the next month in one simple trip.  Ouila!"
Three,"Watch some football with a pint and a plate of chips\n\nWas directed here by a British friends for its authenticity.  It is nice to actually encounter a Brit at a pub, this one is English owned and operated, excellent.\n\nThe beer selection is not the finest picks, but a good average English medley.  The food, I had the fish and chips, was served in large portions and pretty good.  I also had a choice of which kind of fish you'd like.  Is it just me or is ordering fish in a non-seafood focused restaurant in AZ feel like gambling?\n\nAll in all, I had a nice time.  If you are a Brit looking for some tones of home, go, if you are from anywhere else and have visited England and want to reminisce, I'd recommend it."
Five,"Who in their right mind does not like Yogurt?  Well this place takes it up a notch by having a really fun atmosphere with old style tv shows playing and some unique decor from years past. \n\nThe Yogurt is really the best part...and the flavors really pop here and are quite tasty.  I found even the Vanilla Bean flavor to be more tasty than other shops in the area.  Prices were reasonable and they do have a frequent customer program that does not require a card.  Worth a repeat visit!  And yes, this is five star worthy because for a yogurt shop, this is as good as it gets!"
Four,"I went to this place for the first time with my friends. The place is mixed between modern and classic. It remind me of the 'Bo Ca 7 Mon' restaurant which is closed. The mirrors are kind of creep me a bit. We are seated. The restaurant have no one there. My friend know a lot about hotpot so I let her order. She order two pot: one spicy and one not spicy. The food is pleasant and the atmosphere is nice. The staff is friendly. I like the thinly slice beef. I am not the one who payed so I can't complain about the price. Everything is good why four star?\n\nThe egg is the one that tip me off. I know the shell is show the freshness of the egg but if you want the customer to crack the cooked egg by themselves, give them a bowl of water or something. The eggs are hot and I feel bad for my friend who burn his hand while cracking it.\n\nThe staff doesn't refill anything unless we ask for it. They rarely check on us. And when we want to pay, we have to wait as well. Guess they don't want money.\n\nThe green tea cheese cake is weird for me. A mixed between cheese and tea not a good idea. And I don't even know what is the black thing they put on. Decoration or sauce of the cake. They don't mixed really well.\n\nOtherwise, I will come back here to eat again. Maybe this time I will order the food."
Five,"In town visiting for another week, and back to MacAlpine's I go! There are several more restaurants or cafes in the area that are good places to go, but MacAlpine's is the one that will keep bringing me back over and over. It's certainly a real taste of nostalgia. In addition to the great food, the real draw is the atmosphere and ambience that you immediately get when you walk in the door. The old soda fountain (in working order), all of the retro furniture, antiques, vintage clothing, and friendly waitresses who dress the part. It's worth the trip if you want to step back in time, take it easy, and enjoy a bit of the past!"
Two,"Sadly, not the best breakfast. \n\nThe interior is very cute and they carry about their pig theme very tastefully (meaning the place isn't covered from head to toe pigs). Our waitress, Tammy, was extremely quick and friendly. And other waitstaff would buzz by with the coffee carafe for refills.\n\nMy husband's pancakes were undercooked in the center and had to be refired. I had the eggs Benedict. The sauce is extremely thick and a bit salty and the eggs were over poached and looked like hard little balls smothered in sauce. My applewood smocked bacon I ordered on the side was so hard it was difficult to eat.\n\nBut it's really the little details, like the not completely full chai tea and the discovery of dirty silverware rolled up in my napkin that leaves me with an ugh feeling.  Don't get me wrong, I was immediately brought new silverware, but the lack of attention to catch that before rolling it up in a napkin makes me wonder what else gets over looked.\n\nI'll give it another try before completely washing my hands over it, but it is going to have to work a little harder to change my mind completely."
One,"We gave this place 2 chances and both times we had aweful customer service. The waitress was overwhelmed on both occasions, missing items that we ordered. The onion rings, fries, nacho chips were soggy, no crispy outside...the onion ring was so chewy that I couldn't eat it...the nacho chips were soaked in the dip toppings and also soggy.  The waiting time on both occassions was ridiculous...I'm not sure we will ever go back...don't order these items.....it looks like the other reviewers had a good experience but I will not be returning....best wishes...hope your servers will get some help, less tables, more service..."
Five,"Sadly I forget how close I live to this AJ's. Typically I'll pick up groceries at Whole Foods, Costco, or even the Safeway that's close to us. \n\nBut for the Super Bowl, I wanted to get some smaller portioned appetizers and deli foods without sacrificing quality. (Lightbulb moment -- I remembered AJ's.)\n\nThey had quite a spread of various choices perfect for game day. The meatballs... oh my god. Picked up a palmier for me in the bakery - - which was delicioso and perfect in every way (sans the calories and sugar content). \n\nTurned back around to the deli and got some sliced salami..... wonderful pepper jack cheese. Up now to the dairy area to find some dips, and went with an awesome local made Tzatziki. Went over to the produce and got some carrots and celery. But... made a last pit stop in the wine section. \n\nWow. How awesome -- they had a sommelier on hand, helping me select the exact wine, taste, quality, price range that I was looking for. I soooo appreciated that! He confirmed my choice and really helped me. That was awesome. \n\nOff to the check-out experience - - and wow, what a friendly check-out lady!! Clearly she loves working here, and it was such a treat to be respected as a customer. (Whether she knows she did that or not -- I believe that is just how she treats all customers. But it really did affirm why it was alright to spend maybe, just a wee bit more.)\n\nCustomer service is everything these days. I think I'll find another time, very soon, to shop here again."
Five,"I went here a couple of weeks ago when I was in the area shopping for a new Bento box. I picked up some subs for dinner, along with a few items I haven't had since I've moved out here from New York. \n\nI got the italian beef special, and the boy got some sort of italian meat masterpiece. Mine was delicious, and he seemed to really enjoy his. I also got a bag of wise potato chips since I haven't had them in FOREVER. YUM. (I also got an assortment of italian cookies, because seriously, who doesn't need some delicious rainbow cookies in their life?)\n\nOverall, this place is awesome. The men behind the register were hilarrrrious. The woman behind the cookie counter was really helpful, but totally evil because she was steering me towards all sorts of delcious goodies that I shouldn't be eating.\n\nI will definitely be going here again when I get a craving for some New York subs. Mmm."
Three,"""3 1/2 Stars.\n\nRecommended when I first moved to Phoenix by a Korean friend of mine, I ventured to Seoul Jung for lunch and had an all around pretty decent meal. It's in, say, an \up-and-coming\"""" part of Glendale, I guess and when you walk in the first thing you smell is fresh paint (they seem to be re-doing the interiors), but hey, I don't mind that toxic fresh paint smell (don't get me started on rubber cement when I was in 1st grade).\n\nAnyway, since I was running errands (ie. taxes), I was dining solo today and therefore abstained from doing actual barbeque. However, the tables I did see folks grilling on (although it was not crowded at all on this Friday lunch hour), had meat which looked and smelled great. \n\nI ordered the bi bim bap (sizzling rice in a stone pot topped with sauteed and seasoned veggies and thinly sliced beef) with hot bean paste and when it got to me I was mildly disappointed, because it didn't look as tantalizing as the one my colleague had at Chuhgajib a few weeks ago. Also, the amount of beef in the dish was miniscule - it was pretty much veggie anyway. And I thought they were going to cook WITH the hot bean paste. Instead I just got a plastic squirt bottle of hot bean paste on the side. This was worth the extra $1 from the regular bi bim bap? Oh well. At least on the upside, it still tasted pretty good. \n\nThe banchan (a number of complimentary vegetable/seaweed side dishes served in small bowls) wasn't nearly as varied as Chuhgajib either, but the kimchi was definitely hotter (which was a bonus for me).\nI was looking forward to ending the meal with a bowl of sikhye (chilled sweet rice soup) but none came. Some unmelted Orbit peppermint gum in my car had to suffice instead.\n\nThe friendly, and dare I say very striking, server seemed a bit harried running around the dining room by herself, but the service was good. I can't give a full review of either this place or Chuhgajib until I come with a carnivorous group and actually have their BBQ (ie. grill on the table), but the star ratings stand as far as the other offerings go.\n\nIf someone asked me to come back here to Seoul Jung for a meal, I'd say \""""sure\"""" - for 10 bucks it was a fairly satisfying meal - but I'd also say, \""""Well, there's this other Korean  joint a few miles further...\""""\n\nHowever, in this neighborhood of Glendale, I'd definitely say it's the best thing going."""""""
Three,"Maybe more like 3.5 stars.  Does someone at Yelp not understand the power of a fraction?\n\nWe went on the advice of friends, expecting to see bellies shaking, plates breaking, and all around havoc.  Unfortunately, depending on how you look at it, no such luck.  The entertainment does not start until 7:45.  We arrived after 6 and were the only diners there, but we were warmly welcomed by who I assume is the owner.\n\nThe server/bartender generously offered me tastings of two Greek white wines.  Then proceeded to fill up my chosen glass, and I mean fill it up, to the top.  Was it the best wine?  No, but there was a lot of it!\n\nWe ordered the baked Kefalograviera flaming cheese as an appetizer.  Cheese on fire is always fun, but the cheese itself...just okay.  It's a hard sheep's milk cheese, salty.\n\nSince I'm horribly indecisive when it comes to food, I had the Fantasia platter.  It included dolmade, pastichio (a lasagna), moussaka (layers of eggplant and potato with a red meat sauce), arni psito (leg of lamb),  and kota Athenian (chicken with mushrooms and artichokes).  The lamb and moussaka were delicious, and I would recommend either.  The lasagna was okay, but nothing special.  The chicken dish was disappointing to me.  It was dry and lacked flavor.\n\nOur service was great, attentive without being obtrusive.  And the owner thanked us as we left.  Seems like it could definitely be a fun place while there's entertainment...hmmm, possibly the makings for a Yelp event."
Four,"""10/15\n\nPopped in for a late lunch constituting of an Alsatian onion tart and a glass of wine.  I stopped by during happy hour, which meant the tart was $7 (orig. $9), and $2 off glasses of wine.  Bartender Jimmy was kind enough to give me samples of two reds and a rose, before I decided on a Riesling, instead.  Enjoyed the generous pour, which was later added to when Jimmy accidently knocked the decanter down when we shook hands :)  The tart came out a little burnt, and the gruyere was replaced with a milder \fromage blanc,\"""" but overall, it still made for a very tasty lunch/dinner!  Photos will prove that I ate at least 5.5 slices.  Read my lips: I ATE THE WHOLE THING.\n\nHappy hour apps menu include onion soup gratin, country pate, escargots, onion tart, and a frisee salad for about $2 less than standard menu.  $5 IPAs, $3 off wine cocktails (reg. $10), and $2 off glasses of wine.  (I'm sure there are discounts on drafts and bottles, too, but since I'm not a beer-drinker, I didn't make a special note of this.)  I hope more food will be added to the menu.  Sad news: the toffee sticky pudding has been omitted from the current menu, with no hope of it coming back again.  (Strange that, since Jimmy said it was a very popular dessert.)  The crowd this Monday afternoon was very thin (4:00'ish)- a couple of tables outside, and me at the bar.  A man sat at a table behind me waiting for his date, and another man who recently relocated from San Fran sat a couple of seats from me later on.  Looks like a decent wine list.  Another HH special- a complimentary cheese plate ($18 value) accompanies each bottle of wine ordered (prices range from $30 and up)!"""""""
Five,"""Ever since I left Los Angeles I've kept an eye out for a unique, (I hate to use the word) \alternative\"""" store where I can drop a paycheck.

Four,"On the lovely Sunday over MLK weekend, my friends and I rode our bikes down to this joint to see what was a-happenin'. What was happening at the outdoor bar was a huge gay circuit party, which was kind of awesome to see on a Sunday afternoon. We veered left, to grab some food before shoehorning ourselves into the Rebar gaiety. Service was a little weird in that we kind of stood around waiting for someone to acknowledge us and be seated - Do we go inside, just have a seat? what? But then we were cheerfully seated on the patio without much waiting. \n\nNitty-gritty: chips and salsa were good, but the salsa was totally the old spicy smoky one they had at Ticoz, I swears! (loved it then, not sure what the slight twist they did to it for Bliss, but it's aight still)\n\nTortilla pizza thing with the pesto, tomato and mozz: meh. there was no zip to it. Very oily and heavy.\n\nShrimp tempura tacos? Some tasty business. Generously filled with fattie shrimps, and just fresh, crispy and delicious. Didn't come served with any lemon wedges, so we totally ghetto fished the wedges out of our water glasses, and it made a big diff. \n\nNot so great was waiting half an hour for our cocktail order. That's the sucky thing about restaurant service when the waiter has to depend on the bar to make drinks for them. Considering how slammed the bar was with cocktailing 'mos, I understand, but it makes for bad service over on the restaurant side. We were comped our delicious white sangrias for having to wait so long, and that was very much appreciated.\n\nAnd then, we went to the bar. It was less packed than when we arrived, but still pretty populated, the bartender, David, was just catching up and picking up all the crap he had to clean up after being hit so hard. I thought he was the only bartender there, but it turns out there was another one at the decidedly less busy inside bar area. Didn't seem like outdoor guy had much help, which sucks. I'm sure they made good money that day, but could have probably made a sh*t-ton more with better staffing. \n\nDespite David clearly being pummelled, he was amazingly even-tempered, gracious and polite, and made excellent cocktails, though we had to coach him (only the once) to chill the vodka in our bombers. It was a great place to be on a Sunday afternoon, just hanging out, unpretentious, and 2-4-1 doesn't suck one bit. Definitely will be rolling down there some more."
Five,"Simply put, my favorite lunch destination in Arizona. AppleCafe offers delicious wraps, salads, burgers, and breakfast served all day! They are also well-known for their amazing smoothies. The food is fresh, hot and generally very healthy. \n\nI always order a wrap, and my favorite would be The Big Daddy (egg, cheese, potato) but I have never had a bad experience. \n\nThere is ample parking. The interior features indoor/outdoor seating with two TVs usually tuned to ESPN News. The decorum celebrates the owner's NYC roots which inspired the name (i.e. The Big Apple). FYI, it closes at 7 pm, but offers $1 longnecks during Happy Hour.\n\nThis is a great spot! Check it out, and you'll thank me."
Five,"""If I'm not the first person to review a place, I usually try to add something to the to sum total of review knowledge provided.

I have trouble ordering as there are many things that look appetizing, but even when sticking with the basics, i.e. scrambled eggs, hashbrowns and pancakes, I leave smiling and full. The service has always been good and the food has always appeared quickly after ordering.\n\nIf you find yourself looking for \a breakfast place\"""" this should be your destination."""""""
Four,"While on a recent adventure with a childhood friend, we decided we wanted Korean BBQ.  We normally frequent other establishments but a while back, someone had told me about this place.  So by chance, we stumbled upon Chuhgajib.\n\nDuring our an hour and a half extravagant lunch, we were the only ones in there.  I normally try to stray away from barren restaurants but we were already spotted by the owner.  He had sat us down in a very artistic yet uncomfortable table and that's when our feast began~\n\n- Haemul Pa Jun [Seafood and Veggie Pancake]:  The haemul pa jun was delicious!  It had the most amazing dipping sauce and was quite a large dish.  I've had various kinds of kimchi pancakes at other Korean BBQ places but I think this place probably tops the cake with better dipping sauce.\n\n- Jap Chae [Stir-fried Glass Noodles with Vegetables]:  The jap chae was pretty standard.  It had a lot of vegetables and stayed insanely hot throughout our meal.  \n\n- Bulgogi [Marinated BBQ Beef]:  Like the jap chae, their bulgogi was pretty standard.  I did enjoy the sauce that they marinated the beef in.  It was very flavorful and cooked to perfection!\n\nOverall, Chuhgajib is a pretty nice place --- not my favorite but pretty damn good!"
Three,"I've never had any real problems with this store.  It is your typical lower income neighborhood grocer.  \nWhat really bugs me about ALL the Fry's stores is their waste with receipts.  Call me a hippy, but more than half of the receipt paper has nothing to do with my purchase.  I buy 1 item and they hand me a receipt 12 inches long!  With all the stores doing that it equates to many thousands of pounds of paper wasted every year unnecessarily!  Hundreds of trees are dying because these guys just don't give a shit.\nYa, ya, I know, it's probably the least of this companies waste issues, but it's one that's handed to me every time I shop there, staring me in the face.  I don't like it and I don't like supporting it."
Four,"Great burgers and menu offerings.  You would expect to get a good burger with a name like that and you do.  The sweet potato fries, Frenched fried onions, and Salmon Salad are very good too.  \n\nThe decor, location, and menu are restaurant alternative for the area.  \n\nThe menu was a little confusing and little pricey yet the quality of the food is there and considering the location of the restaurant pricing isn't an issue.  \n\nI do recommend to restaurant to others."
Three,"""We visited Wildfish for the first time and brought a foodie friend who was visiting from CA. I noticed it took the server longer then usual to great us and get us set up with water. And we didn't have enough side plates. Minor stuff but noticeable. We ordered the scallop appetizer (a special) and the pot stickers. Both were really delicious.  I ordered the sole, which was good comfort food, but there was nothing special about it. It was well prepared. My fiance had the ahi steak, which was also well prepared and was quite tasty. What I will say is the prices are pretty high and while the quality of the food is also high, there is no \wow factor\"""", nothing that stands out to me. The service is helpful and friendly, the ambiance is nice, the fish is fresh.....but there is nothing special or unique about the food here, which I expected for the price. Between the three of us we spent about $170 (not including gratuity). I will commend the waiter on bringing me a replacement glass of Pinot Noir and comping the first one I ordered b/c it was not to my liking. However, the second glass he recommended and I drank was double the price....All in all a good experience, but not really worth the high prices."""""""

Five,"One word--3 syllables--FAB-U-LOUS\n\nAll the best parts of Scottsdale without the annoying snobs!\n\nParty of 4 went yesterday and we had a varied sampling from the menu. Had the olives and pub board as appetizers along with a very nice Spanish red wine that was suggested by the server. The Pub Board was fantastic with Portuguese chorizo, cheese, and a very yummy homemade pretzel. The olives were a really great sampling of many different types and they all complimented our wine well too. \n\nHubby had the Autostrada with the potato cheese soup, I had the 9 Iron with soup, friends split the Proscuitto with Brie with chips. All were positively perfect!\n\nFor dessert, we ordered a bottle of a white Spanish wine Fuente Milano and it had a nice grapefruity after taste that was very cleansing on the palate before we had the Chocolate Bouchon, the Creme Brulee, and the salted carmel sundae. OMG...all were so yummy and the wine went perfectly!\n\nThe nicest part about Postino is that it isn't on a main Scottsdale Rd. drag....it's actually nestled on a side street off of 39th St. and Campbell. You'd never know it was there if you weren't looking for it but apparently plenty of people know about it because it was hopping at noon yesterday.\n\nIf you haven't tried it....go. You won't regret it. It was hip, fun, and the food was realistically priced and absolutely DELICIOUS!"
One,"""If I could give this place no stars, I would. I was once very fond of this place. That was until they changed directors. \n\nThey aren't consistent with sending home daily reports with the children. I'm the kind of parent that likes to know how my kids did in daycare. I like to know the good and the bad. When they sent home reports, hey would say \had a great day!\"""" Well, what made their day so great? Also, they would send home a good report, but when I talk with the teacher, they would tell me how bad my child was. I asked why it wasn't on the reports I received and they said they write the reports mid day. How backwards is that? There are some teachers there who really seemed to care, but there seems to be too many cooks in the kitchen. The management team would often refer to \""""the owners\"""" but when I asked who the owners were they said they don't distribute that information. Huh?! If someone is going to be around my children, I want to know who they are! They do have a clean facility. They also have a lot of different daily activities for the children to play with. But they need better trained staff. All of their teachers are not certified. \n\nAlso, I had an issue with kids bullying my son. They didn't try to resolve it. I requested a meeting with he kids parents because most people know that one major factor in resolving bullying is with the help of all parents involved. Well, they out right ignored me.

Four,"I am also disappointed at the poor reviews of Los Sombreros. I have never been unhappy with the food or atmosphere here. Sometimes the service is a little slow on the first contact, but once you order the food comes pretty quickly--and it's good! I've been here 5 or 6 times and always leave with leftovers--large portions in general are served! The margaritas are so-so in my opinion, but they have a huge tequila selection and lots of mescal. The best things on the menu? The lamb is delicious but better for you spice lovers; carnitas are superb; yummy chunky guacamole (although this could probably come in a bigger bowl); huitlacoche crepas; and lots of their specials (i had really good duck tacos once! unfortunately i have yet to see it on the specials again).

Two,"My partner brought me here for what we thought would be a nice, romantic birthday dinner at a cozy neighborhood spot. We hadn't been in a year or so, and were both disappointed - here's the good + bad:\n\nThe good:\n1. Shared plate #1 - slow-roasted pork, green chile cornbread casserole and maple-glazed carrots were all excellent, especially the pork which was so flavorful. Would have this again in an instant.\n2. Classic lime mojito - very good if not just a bit sweet (but see point about drinks below)\n3. The happy hour menu - 1/3 of the dinner page - looked great. 3-6pm, may have to give that a try instead of dinner\n\nThe bad:\n1. Place was empty at 8pm - just one other table inside besides us (plus one guy at bar, one table on patio)\n2. No music until halfway through dinner - then The Cure, Violent Femmes and other 80s alternative - which I like, but not in a sit-down restaurant for dinner. And the bartender sang along occasionally - ugh.\n3. Mixed drinks in a pint glass - never a fan unless at a dive bar.\n4. Out appetizer never came - waiter said he didn't remember us ordering even though he commented that the dish was good when we ordered. With just one other table, a big disappointment. (to his partial credit, he did bring us A SMALL PORTION of the appetizer with our entrees for free)\n5. Shared plate #2 - new york strip, cheddar mashed potatoes and organic green beans were all just OK. Not a fan of the sauce the steak was in, and topping of mushrooms, onions and peppers too heavy. Way too much mashed potatoes and green beans, which were both pretty bland.\n6. Toward the end of our meal, a young boy came into the restaurant and started playing with a ball right next to our table. I am not joking. wtf?\n\nOverall, I'd like to think we just experienced an off-night here. But, attention to details like mood and music  (plus getting everything you ordered) are also important. Some of the food was very good, so we may give it another try sometime - but, truthfully, I think there are a number of better restaurants in the area."
Four,"""To be brief: I am a huge fan of Cho Bandido's.  My family has eating at this restaurant for well over a decade.

However, my last visit my order was taken by a man named Lien. I have only ever worked in customer service positions myself, and have never come across someone so rude and unprofessional.  \n\nIn writing this review I was thinking about giving a 3 star review just for this reason.

Five,"""If there was ever a restaurant deserving 5 stars, this is it.\n\nWe met some friends here on our last night in Arizona and it made a great book-end for the trip. We went on Monday, when they have a $20 deal for a bottle of wine and a plate of bruschetta. The wine that they serve is their \house\"""" wine, but it knocks the socks off of your typical house wine. The Bruschetta makes a great meal by itself if you want. There are 11 choices (various toppings) and you can have up to four different ones per plate (really a long-handled cutting board, which makes for a nice presentation). The Bruschetta is carefully sliced into smaller pieces so that several people can try each kind. Be prepared to eat and drink a lot; it is such a deal that you will have a hard time saying \""""no.\""""\n\nI mostly stuck to the beer that was on draft. There were only two choices, both very good. The draft beer was fresh and refreshing, plus at $7.50 for a small pitcher anytime it was quite a deal. If you come for the earlier happy hour it is $5/pitcher or $5 for a glass of wine, so you can't go wrong. It makes sense to have a small draft beer selection since they are a wine bar and it helps them move through the kegs quickly. I ordered the prosciutto with brie panini, which I had no trouble sharing with my friends. You get the choice of ciabatta or focaccia bread and fresh-made chips or salad- the chips and ciabatta bread were great. Our server helped me pick the ciabatta bread, which she accurately described as the \""""thinner, crispier\"""" one for my panini.\n\nThe service here is amazing. Our servers were very patient and helpful. The busser would give any Indian restaurant a run for their money with his diligent water-refilling, plus he was thoughtful enough to get our server's attention if we needed anything else. Everyone was dressed nicely and very friendly. At one point a piece of bruschetta fell onto the table or the floor. Without even mentioning it, out server brought over a replacement. She must have noticed from somewhere else in the restaurant and wanted to help.\n\nThe restaurant had a very appealing atmosphere. Lights were dim, but not dark. The colors on the walls made it feel vibrant. Chairs and tables were comfortable, well-maintained, and fit in with the style of the restaurant. It might have been louder if we sat inside, but we were on the patio. Outside we sat in the shade (we arrived when it was still daylight) and the water misters helped keep us cool. The bathrooms are in the back corner, opposite of the front door. You might have to ask a server to point out where to go, but they are glad to help. The fact that the bathrooms simply say \""""Both\"""" could be an interesting conversation point if you have to wait in line.\n\nThe parking is valet, but you shouldn't be driving anyway. Take a cab if you can help it, or bring a designated driver. The experience is so nice that you won't want to leave, unless maybe you make a friend to bring with you."""""""

I had the carnitas burrito. And it was tasty and quite hefty, but I'd expect that at the prices their burritos are going for. At first taste, I found it a bit odd. I think maybe they buttered their tortillas cause there was a queer taste that I don't find from other burrito places. The filling was good; the pork was yummy and not dry or stringy.

Four,"A friend suggested this place and when I walked in I could tell it was popular but I went right up to the counter.  I told the guy I'd never been there before so he offered samplers of their popular items.  But then I was confused.  The menu is Chines style pictures on the wall, but the guy was describing a combo platter.  So the menu presentation is horrible (for newbies).  Then when I finally figured out what to order, he went into explaining how to order next time with all their shorthand- even more confusing- and the assumption is that I'd be eating there every day.  BUT, the food was AWESOME.  I can't believe my mother in law lives like a mile from here.  Now when my wife says she wants to visit her mom, I'll be mor enthusiastic about making the trek!"
Four,"Had a nice dinner here with some friends and family last Saturday night and it was really good.  The eggplant parmesan was good, but two of us could have split it.

He liked it, but wasn't thrilled with the bacon.  It would have probably been better with just the two main ingredients.  The restaurant is casual and hip at the same time."

Four,"""I love the Loco. I really do. We come here several times a month. It's so yummy. \n\nThe chicken is always hot, and it's so tasty. I swear I could swim in the green salsa. It's sooooooo good.\n\nThe chicken is very flavorful and you always see it cooking on the back grill. It's not \cheap\"""" fast food, but you get what you pay for. It's moderate in price, but I think it's well worth it. \n\nThe churros (2 for 99 cents) are like sticks of heaven.\n\nI'm loca for the Loco. :)"""""""
Two,"""They remodeled the place a few years ago - it still sucks. It's usually impossible to find parking. The bathrooms remind me of the \worst toilet in Scotland\"""" from Trainspotting. The people that frequent this place are trying so hard to be different that they just end up being the same. \n\nThis place sprang from a need to have a place in Scottsdale where people could dance and not have to hang around Scottsdale douchebags and snobs and plastics... ironically, this place has become full of a new breed of snobs and douchebags. There's no official dress code, but there is a dress code - you have to look like a fashion disaster or alterna-hipster with your \""""unique\"""" uniform.\n\nIt's nearly impossible to get a drink unless you know someone or look like you know someone or perhaps have fucked someone who works there. It's the kind of place that belongs in Phoenix - it's conveniently located in Scottsdale though. I have friends who love this place, but I just think it's a shit-hole. I'm sure if I was still in College, I'd like it. I'm just too old for this kind of thing - not quite 'cool' enough. What's funny is that a year or so ago, it was more of a punky place."""""""
Two,I deleted my original review on Yelp to repost. I had originally given this place 4 stars and it seems like I'm going to be the first person to bump it down. Thus I'm not sure if the poor quality of my gel manicure that is making me repost only happened to me. The gel manicure I got barely lasted 2 weeks and started peeling easily. I'm disappointed because this place is expensive and I feel like I didn't get my money's worth. Doesn't seem like any one else has had a bad experience but I'm not going to be back.
Five,"My best friend is getting married and I was searching for dress shops by reviews to make sure she had the BEST first experience trying on dresses. I searched the reviews high and low and this was one of my TOP choices. It is very conveniently located in Gainey ranch in Scottsdale. They were very accommodating even when I had to reschedule her appointment last minute! Once we went into the shop, we were worried she wouldn't be able to afford some of their beautiful dresses because of her tight budget! To our surprise- they had her PERFECT dress and under budget! The ladies there were SO knowledgeable and professional and really took the time to explain all of their options and processes. I would recommend Mariee to ANYONE looking for their perfect dress.. They have a remarkable selection of dresses (that no other dress store has)! They ordered her dress and even got it in within a couple of months! They have amazing alterations ladies that are very professional and can accommodate ANY thing you ask of them! The shop don't even charge commission fees to them to keep the alteration costs LOW! & they meet at the shop for all fittings to keep your travel time low and convenient! Thank you Mariee for making everything so amazing and easy!"
Five,"What an awesome place for a private dinner!\n\nI recently had the pleasure of attending an engagement party at Arcadia Room. Not only does the setting provide the perfect ambiance for such an event, but the room comfortably fit about 80 people, with some room to spear.  The food was just decent, but words cannot describe how friendly and accommodating the staff went out of its way to be.\n\nIf you're planning something along the lines of a rehearsal dinner, or looking for a spot for a company christmas party, I highly recommend the Arcadia Room."
Five,"We have been going to this Denny's for 3-4 years now.  My spouse and I have breakfast with our very close friend on Sunday's often.  Our daughter and I go there sometimes on Friday's before school as well as special treat.  Very friendly staff, I cannot remember ever having bad service.  A lot of the servers have been there for the whole time we have been going there.  A lot of them know us.  Very nice people.  It is still Denny's so of course it's not 5 star dining but the service is great!"
Four,"Oddly enough I only came to this location after visiting the new Gilbert location. Have to say I think I like the Gilbert locale better and I'm almost a little sick hearing myself say that. Not sure what was up with the rap music on this visit as I am in love with the music at the other locations. Not a great fan of the valet either as they don't seem to know how to dive manual cars or operate emergency  brakes. \n\nSo, I'm giving this location 4 stars based on the whole concept and the food (and assuming it will be better next time) but in my heart it gets 3 stars."
Three,"I'm not disappointed with Ray's Pizza, I'm just not all that impressed either.  It probably doesn't help that when it comes to the battle of New York vs Chicago pizza, I'm Chicago all the way.\n\nRay's pizza is quite cheesy, the crust is very crunchy.  $2.50 for a generously cut slice (that's for cheese, toppings are extra) isn't too steep.  I had a slice of cheese and a slice of Pesto.  Both were good, just not anything amazing.  I can't say I've ever been to THE Ray's Pizza in New York (or any of the infinite number of other places in New York also called Ray's), so I can't compare if this is anything like the real New York pie.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with Ray's Pizza.  I just wouldn't go out of my way to eat there again."
Four,"My mouth is watering just thinking about the yummy food that we have eaten here.  The sweet-potato fries here are the best ones we've ever had ANYWHERE!  The burgers are ALWAYS cooked to perfection no matter how we order them (I prefer well-done burgers, and my hubby likes them medium with pink in the middle).  The Chinese Chicken salad here (idk if thats what it's actually called, but thats what we call it) is the best ever (ok, it ties with the one at Houstons, but it is a salad that I actually ENJOY eating...and I would normally rather starve than eat a salad).  On the weekends it usually pretty busy and hectic, but it is soooo worth it! Also great for those late-night burger cravings."
One,"Chuy's food is as great as it usually is.  When I lived in Ca, I Chuy's was a regular haunt because the food has need awesome since the original days.  But the service at this particular resturaunt is inexcusable.  One person was given the wrong food.  Mistakes happen... But the manager (who made the mistake on the order) refused to fix it, and actually insisted the person in our party that got the wrong food ordered it that way.  Her argument was that the customer ordered a dinner they hated and she was not going to fix it.\n\nGreat food, when they get the order right.  But service is so bad, you will be best served going elsewhere."
Four,"I was skeptical when my cousin asked me to go to pizza....at 7th St and Bell (we live in Central Phx).  I thought she was a little nuts to drive so far for pizza.  But YUM!  The place ain't fancy.  And the wine is from a really big jug.  However, the pizza was fantastic!  Excellent crispy crust but not at all burnt.  Lots of toppings!  I took some home despite my cousin's protest that the crust wouldn't be as good.  But a few moments in the toaster oven and I had a great leftover.  \n\nI will be back!"
Three,"""Harlow's was busy the saturday morning we stopped in, but fortunately, there was no wait. Standard breakfast food, and good price/performance ratio. The only thing that left me confused was that the meals were delivered with \Butter-like Spread,\"""" containing mostly vegetable oil. Is there really a substantial cost in having real butter? I mean, breakfast at a place like this is all about indulgence, and a time where it's completely socially acceptable to...no, expected that you'll cover your food in real butter, wether it's good for you or not."""""""

Four,"Rest assured, if you need anything and you're in Scottsdale, you can find what you're looking for at Fashion Square Mall. This place is larger than most suburban cities, and probably has an operating budget that would make a congressman blush. \n\nIf you look at it from a store perspective, this mall is 5 stars. They have every store you can think of. Ferragamo, for instance. While most malls have one store with a small selection of Ferragamo, Fashion Square has an entire store dedicated Salvatore and his fine leather goods (Treat yo self!). Same goes for 7 For All Mankind denim...The list goes on. Fashion Square also features a Neiman-Marcus, Barney's Tiffany, pretty much every high end store there is. For those of you that don't make $500,000+ per year, there are also lower cost options like H&M, and middle of the road options like Nordstrom.\n\nIn addition to a ton of stores, there are 6-8 full service, sit down restaurants in addition to the food court and a movie theatre. If they were to let you sleep at Crate and Barrel, you'd never need to leave this mall. \n\nIn terms of downsides...Parking isn't great, and when the mall is busy, it's packed. Even with three stories and hundreds of thousands of square feet, it still feels like a sea of people that you're trying to fight through. Also, it's so damn big that you're constantly fear that you're going to get lost. I've probably been to this mall 30 times and I'm confident that there are 100+ stores that I've yet to stumble upon. \n\nAdditional Note: If you're planning a flash mob and think the mall might be a good spot, just move on. Fashion Square is NOT kind to people flashmobbing in their area."
Four,"""I think Yvette has the right idea for an afternoon treat. The one problem is, I couldn't wait until Friday, I had to go today. It is the perfect afternoon distraction . . . er . . . um . . . I mean treat . . . perfect afternoon TREAT! \n\nThere was a time that I was completely hooked on afternoon frozen yogurt and going almost daily. The winter weather helped break me of that addiction and now I'm back on what others would consider a \normal\"""" schedule. \n\nI love that the flavors change every day and you can print a calendar from their website showing the schedule of flavors. There are about eight different flavors in any given day, and one of them is a \""""No Sugar Added\"""" flavor. \n\nThe OCD side of me really shines when a new month starts. I print the calendar, take out my highlighter, highlight all of my favorite flavors and those of my fro-yo addicted coworkers, and hang the calendar outside my cube wall. That way it is much easier for us to tell when we need to work time into our schedule to hit the yogurt shop. \n\nThe flavors that are typically highlighted are: \n- Chocolate Covered Banana & Marshmallow (served on the same day, really good as a swirl) \n- Pistachio (really good with almonds as a topping, I tried getting pistachios as a topping and it was a little much) \n- Butterscotch (reminds me of pudding cups back in the day) \n- German Chocolate & Caramel Custard (also served on the same day and very good as a swirl) \n- Irish Cream & Kahlua (not served on the same day, but the closest thing to drinking at work) \n- S'mores (delicious with a graham cracker topping) \n- And every once in a while I like the Reese's with (you know it) Reese's as a topping!! \n\nSee, with so many delicious flavors, it was hard NOT to go everyday. They have plenty of other flavors as well. The only one that I tried that I was not a fan of was the Root Beer Float. The flavor was there, but it wasn't the same without the soda! \n\nEither way, stop by in the afternoon for a sweet treat, and maybe I'll see you there!"""""""
Five,"Medical care can be compared to County level care or Mayo Clinic level care. County level care is poor. Mayo Clinic is world renowned. All Star Animal Hospital is Mayo Clinic level care for your pets. They are very well staffed so they can take time with you and your pet. They are more expensive (WAY more expensive) than the original vet I chose. I had a budget problem and had to take my puppy to Crossroads Towne Center Vet and received county level care. They were affordable but offered crap service. When I needed my puppies sutures removed after only 7 days, they refused to even see my puppy. I could see my pup had healed faster than normal, but they wouldn't even see me. I took my puppy to All Star and started to get the same speech (in a much nicer way). All Star was competent and knew 10-14 days is the normal healing time, but they took the time to look at my puppy. The doctor saw I was right and took the sutures out. All Star is where I will always take my dog. They are TOPS!!!!"
Two,"I ordered take out from here last night, and I love the idea of having New York filtered water in your crust. This is supposed to be the ingredient that makes real NY style pizza taste the way it does. I ended up ordering a sicilian style pizza, and got the full size pie. \n\nMy only complain in general would be the cost for my pie. Total after tax was 29 bucks, and thats a lot of money for just one pie. I understand the cost of food and labor along with the better quality ingredients, but I don't even spend that much on an Oreganos deep dish pie, and theirs actually taste better! The sicilian here doesn't really stand out. There's not enough sauce or cheese, and the toppings are just so so. The crust was nothing special, and I honestly thought that Pizza Hut's pan pizza tasted better. I got the Vinny, which has five toppings on it, and split my pizza with two on one side and three on the other. I got meatballs and tomatoes, and pepperoni, mushrooms, and black olives. Meatballs were dry as shit and sliced. Even Barro's has better meatballs! Everything else was just so so, I can get the same thing but better at Barros, at a fraction of the cost! \n\nAll in all, two stars for high cost and nothing to back it up. I get it, a bunch of people hype up your joint and that's fine, but follow through with it and make that 30 dollar pie blow my taste buds out of the water!"
Four,"I love the Pointe Hilton!  The lazy river is why I go here every year.  I get a great tan after the one weekend a year I spend here.  They also have a bunch of slides and it's pretty much like a water park for kids. The rooms are nice and well kept too. \n\nI usually have a good experience with the people that visit here as well, except for the last time, when a creepy guy wanted to take a picture of my sister and me in our bathing suits while going down the river. I definitely can't fault The Pointe Hilton for the creepy guy-- WEIRD though for sure!! \n\nThe only complaint I really have is when I am on the lounge chairs laying by the pool, I always put my flag up for service and it takes so long for the servers to pay attention, so I usually just go up to the bar to get my drink."
Five,To date I have found 2 great yogurt shops. This first is Cherry On Top in So. Cal. and the other is MoJo's at Phoenix North. Now I have found the 3rd and possibly the best. Yogurtime not only has a big variety of flavors that taste great but a staff that is quick to help with the tough decisions and taste testing. I have been in several times since my first encounter and met Jesse the manager who has made a positive impression each time. His friendly enthusiasm when he introduced himself made my whole family feel welcome. \n\nThis is a great spot to stop by for a date or after catching a movie at the Harkins across the street. Two big thumbs up for me.
Four,"It's a DMV people, what else do you expect. The service is usually slow, rude and short in these places. \n\nThis is my first experience in an AZ DMV though and although I had to sit there and wait for my number to be called, the service I received was very pleasant and quick. \n\nThank goodness I don't have to be back for another year though as those seats are not very comfortable. They did spell my fianc\u00e9s name wrong on his license so he has to go back. Hahahah"
Four,"""I have wanted to try St. Francis for some time. I drive by it all the time and it always looks full of people having a good time. I went here with a group of friends on a Wednesday night and was surprised to find out there was a 45 minute wait. The hostess was very friendly and said we could go the bar area or the area by the fire. While it is nice that we could hang out and have a drink I thought 45 minutes on a Wednesday was kind of a long time to wait for a table. Maybe I am just getting impatient as I get older...\n\nI had the St Francis lemonade which was delicious and refreshing. For an appetizer we split the baked goat cheese. It was so good we ordered a second order. It was probably my favorite thing of the entire meal. For dinner I split the chicken flat bread with my sister. It was a good size portion and came with caramelized onions, chicken, fennel, and arugula. While it was tasty it didn't \wow\"""" me. Two other of my friends both got the citrus salad and it looked pretty good and was something you wouldn't normally make for yourself at home - so maybe I will try this next time.\n\nThe service was friendly but I did feel as if our server was repeating things directly from the menu like a robot and he couldn't really make a good suggestion on what to try for food or wine. Overall, I think St. Francis is good place for groups or for a romantic dinner it just wasn't as spectacular as I thought it would be."""""""
One,"I don't know who voted them the best sandwich shop in America, but I can guess that they...\n1. Don't have taste buds\n2. Have only ever had sandwiches from this place, nowhere else\n3. Have endless amounts of money.\n\nFor two sandwiches and one drink, it cost me $15. Ridiculous. I wouldn't have been so annoyed had it been a good sandwich, but it was the worst sandwich I've ever had. The bread was comparable to cafeteria bread, the tuna salad was nothing but mayo and tuna, the lettuce tasted and looked old, the cheese was tasteless and stiff, and the tomato (read: a single slice of tomato) was sliced so thin that they might as well have not even bothered putting it on the sandwich. I'm actually quite surprised that I didn't get food poisoning.\n\nMy only advice is to head over to Whole Foods and spend a fraction of the cost on a much better and fresher sandwich."
Four,"A few days ago my favorite restaurant blogger, Seth Chadwick, wrote about a dim sum place with a twist - no carts. Instead you check off items on a printed menu, much like those in many sushi places, with an accompanying page of photos of the various dishes. I thought this was a great idea since I've always been intimidated by the servers who push the cart up to your table and try to force unwanted dishes on you.\n\nChina Chan is at the Metro Center, a place we seldom go. The freestanding building is unprepossessing, to say the least, as is the interior. A few sad lanterns hang from the ceiling. That's about it for ambience. But the servers are very nice, and those who speak English are happy to make suggestions and give explanations of the various dishes. There are 28 dim sum dishes at $1.80 each including spareribs with black bean sauce, baked BBQ pork buns, and tripe with ginger and scallions. At $2.85 you can get steamed lotus flavor rice, pan fried rice noodles with dried shrimp, and 7 others. Next are those at $3.55; steamed shrimp filled rice noodles, beef tripe, chinese broccoli and shrimp roll steamed rice noodle. Finally, the chef's specials, eight of them, are priced from $5.99 to $8.50. From this last group we chose roast pork and roast duck. We also selected daikon cakes (I know these as turnip cakes) at $1.80. Lastly, from the regular menu we ordered eggplant in garlic sauce. Our waitress, licking her lips, suggested we add beef to the dish and that we pour lots of chili oil on top. \n\nThe roast pork and daikon arrived first. Chunks of moist, slowly roasted pork were generously sprinkled with the cracklings of skin. Decadent. And the portion was huge. The daikon cakes, three large rectangles enough to serve 6 as part of a meal, were the silkiest I've had, with just enough pan fry crust to satisfy. A small bowl of hoisin was served alongside. Then the duck and eggplant were served. The eggplant sauce was quite mild (our server was right about the chili oil) but beautifully flavored and the beef slices were a great addition. Again, the serving was huge. I don't recall how much this cost, but the dishes from the menu are remarkably low priced. The only thing not stellar was the roast duck. The skin wasn't crackly, and there was lots of fat. \n\nBoth menus contained dishes you don't often find, and there were lots of Asian diners, so China Chans felt like the real deal. I suggest you go there with lots of people so you can sample a great variety of dim sum. Give us a call - we're ready to go!!"
Five,"""Our trips to Fashion Square Mall  ALWAYS included lunch at the Nordstrom's Cafe.

Five,"Charleen and Pavle have done it again.  Blowing us away with outstanding food.  I came here on opening day, and I can't believe it has taken me this long to write anything about it.  This quaint little place, I would say about 30 seats is such a delight.  I going to say Pavle should earn a Michellin Star just on service alone, ha ha.  He knows exactly what to do the make the customer feel comfortable dining in his restaurant.  He did the same for me when I went to FnB.  \n\n   Glancing over the tiny menu, only 6 offerings, Pavle suggested that I try a Cheese and fruit board that wasn't listed on the menu.  So I trusted his opinion.  For the life of me I don't remember what type of cheese it was, but it was fantastic!  I could eat the hell out of that all day long.  It also came with bread, dates, walnuts, and a fruit mustarda.  A great way to begin the meal.\n\n   I ordered the Jidori chicken sandwich which came with giardiniera.  Let me tell you this chicken sandwich was a mouthgasm.  God I'm craving it right now.  Succulent chicken with veg and Manchengo cheese, hmmm.  I don't like giardiniera, so I can't fault them for that.  I understand the combination, it's just not for me.  So next time I will just get the sandwich.\n\n   Although I am not a wine drinker I usually still look at the wine menu.  Baratins was pretty darn expansive.  I can't tell whether its impressive or not though, heh.  The bottom line of Baratin is that if you love FnB food, but at a fraction of the price come here and you will not be disappointed!!"
Four,"We went to Biscuits for the first time this Friday night for an early dinner.\n\nWe were disappointed to find that breakfast is not served all day on Fridays, as they have their Friday Fish Fry.  \n\nNo matter, it just gives us an excuse to come back.\n\nThe chicken fried chicken was perfectly crispy and seasoned well.  DH ate EVERYTHING on his plate.  The only thing he did not really love was that the corn was heavily buttered.  Next time he will ask for no butter.  \n\nThe smoked chicken jalapeno alfredo was good, but I may skip it in the future.  I only found three small slices of jalapeno and I was hoping for something spicy.  This was very mild and the pasta was drowned in sauce.  Some people might like a lot of sauce, but I prefer it to be just coated... not floating.  It did come with two pieces of delicious garlic toast, which was a definite bonus.  If I do order it again, I will just ask for the sauce on the side and extra jalapenos for heat!\n\nDD just had a grilled cheese with applesauce.  She did not like the applesauce because she happened to bite into a spoonful of cinnamon.  Oops!  DH didn't stir it for her and I sort of missed that, as well!\n\nI asked the waitress for a biscuit and she brought one over to me to try,  It was actually very good.  It was not sweet like some other reviewers mentioned.  I found it heavy, but I like my biscuits that way!\n\nThe best part about Biscuits was the service.  The waitress was very nice and helpful.  One of the ladies from up front came by to check on us and even brought us a to go menu when we told her it was our first visit.  I mentioned their website had been down, but she said it should be up by now and that a lot of customers had mentioned it.  It's not up yet... hmm.\n\nWe will definitely come back to Biscuits again... next time for breakfast."
Four,"I've been back to the District several times since my initial review as it is within walking distance from my work.  This visit alone was for one reason; the beers they have on tap.  Craft beer in downtown Phoenix isn't the easiest thing to find.  You'll find Stone, Rogue, Black Dog, San Tan, Four Peaks, Nimbus, Lagunitas, plus I'm sure I'm missing a couple.  Nothing abnormal in the beer world, but in downtown it's rare to see an establishment like this moving away from the 'big beer' trend seen so many other places.  The craft beer movement is here & the District knows this.\n\nThe bartenders that evening, Mitch & Amanda, were quite knowledgeable about what they were pouring.  I learned some history about Black Dog I hadn't known.  No food this time around, but I'll still support anywhere that supports local like their menu does."
Four,"I get the skinny on good Vietnamese from my father and he says Maxim is the best when you want Mi, the pork broth soup with egg noodles, wontons, barbeque pork, shrimp and the fixin's. He took me there and he's right. It is the best Mi soup in the Valley, if Dragonfly (in Mesa) doesn't give it some good competition.\n\nI have to be honest and say that I haven't tried anything else, but I can tell you that SO MANY Chinese/Japanese restaurants of Maxim's caliber are really owned and run by Vietnamese. Deb K. is so right on this one--I can attest that the Chinese name and food is there to attract business. The real deal is the Vietnamese soup--the Mi. Those clever Vietnamese...\n\nIt's not very pretty, which others have stated, but if you can handle the sub-par cleanliness and decor in exchange for an amazing, albeit cheap bowl of soup, please do. It's definitely a Yelper's kind of place."
Five,"Totally loved it!  It's so quaint and charming.  I have been to some of the best hotels in the world, and this place rocks!  Here we go:\n-charming and professional.  Not uptight like the Ritz Cartlon.  Very, very personable staff\n-amazing food and will do special meals like vegan and gluten free.  Breakfast served at 6AM and coffee bar open.  So nice to be served early as some hotels have client wait till 7AM\n-wonderful conceirge who helped me w local restaurants and hiking \n-amazing spa.  It's like you have the place to yourself and the staff knows what they are doing\n-really nice gym w great equipment\n-little nocks and crannies of fireplaces, fountains and outdoor spaces.

Four,"Boulders sits in an old Old Chicago franchise with some reworking done to make it somewhat bike-oriented. It's in a weird area, on Broadway between Priest and Mill, and a little difficult to find because the sign on Broadway is fairly small.\nWe came for the $5 sandwiches and $3 beer that were advertised on their web site for their all-day Saturday happy hour. When we finally stumbled upon the place, the entrance was fairly hard to find. It's in the back. Upon entering, you find a cavernous, two-story, multi-leveled, dimly lit restaurant with tons of big booths and various separated rooms. Kind of strange. Almost completely empty.\nI got a look at the menu and immediately realized that the special was actually $6 sandwiches and $3.50 beers on tap. Whatever.\nThe draft selection is a little bit better than you'd find at an Old Chicago location, with some Dogfish Heads, a Rogue and a Ska. They also had a Deschutes red on tap, which I had never had, that wasn't on the menu because it was so new. A lot of the beers are not available for the happy hour prices, such as the aforementioned Dogfish Heads and Ska. So I opted for the Rogue Dead Guy Ale and started looking at the menu.\nThey have quite a bottles selection too, leaving off a lot of the American crap (Bud, Coors, etc.), which I really admire in places, and sticking to the more well-known micros, with a few Four Peaks and that Papago orange stuff to round out the locals. They even had a couple of Nimbuses (Tucson). The bottles were not on special, but I prefer draft beer anyway.\nThe sandwiches and burgers list was a bit more than I had expected. Chicken, turkey, a sirloin (not available as the $6 special) and a couple of veggie options. For sides, they had salads, fries (waffle) and their new, housemade potato chips. I had the southwest turkey with the chips.\nThose chips are basically thick pieces of potato, lightly fried with a bit of seasoning. They were very good, and I was glad that I got them. The sandwich was nice: deli turkey, cheese and a bit of chipotle sauce for a little kick.\nMy girlfriend got the burger, and I was a bit jealous. It was a rectangular patty on what looked like a ciabatta bun. She said it was one of the best burgers she had in a while and actually finished the thing off, which is really rare for her.\nService was good. I felt bad that there were so few people in there, but the guy was really, really nice and attentive.\nTwo beers and the sandwich ended up $13 just for me, which is a pretty good deal when you think about it.\nDownside is that it's a little dingy inside. They should probably work a bit on cleaning the place up. Maybe get some sort of interior design consultant to come in and revamp the place a bit. Also, the location is just so weird. I've stayed at that Motel 6 across the street years ago, and I never thought I'd opt to spend any additional time in that neighborhood.\nBut I would definitely go back, and would recommend it to those who like their beer. Maybe a good alternative to Four Peaks since they're perpetually packed, although some people may be scared off by the atmosphere here. Give it a chance!"
Four,"Ever since I moved here from the OC (where I've been super spoiled when it comes to good Pho)...I've been on an unsuccessful quest to find good Pho.  Pho is not something I want to eat on a regular basis...but there are days when I just want a good bowl of Pho and it's frustrating when I have to drive around and settle for something mediocre.\n\nI wanted to come here about a month back but they were closed on the day I wanted to come (again, I was having some Pho craving issues).  But today was my lucky day because all the stars lined up and here we are at Pho Van!  Walking in, the restaurant felt really open, clean and inviting.  The people running the place were friendly and attentive.  I did notice prices were a little on the high side for a Pho joint.\n\nWe got the Pho Dac Biet and found the broth steaming hot and perfectly seasoned.  There was plenty of noodles and ample amount of meat w/a nice dish of very fresh herbs & veggies.  The only thing I wasn't thrilled w/was the obvious lack of tripe (which was my favorite thing in the Pho)...I didn't really find any and I had to read the menu again to be sure that it was included as part of the description.  The second thing I wasn't impressed w/was the beef/meatballs...they were kinda on the hard & dense side and wasn't plump & juicy.\n\nWe also got the house special Bun Rieu...and again, the broth was steaming hot and perfectly seasoned and tasty.  I was also pleasantly surprised to see escargot (which I love) in it...even if it was on the chewy side (lucky for me, I'm okay w/my escargots being chewy...although the boyfriend didn't care for them that way).  One thing that prevented this bowl from getting 5 stars is the shrimp cakes/dumplings in this noodle (which is suppose to be the highlight of the meal) was completely lacking in shrimps...it was disappointingly made up mostly of ground pork w/just a hint of shrimp.\n\nMaybe I'm just being really particular because I've searched and waited so long for a restaurant w/this much promise to come along.  Overall, the food was really good and I would def go back and I do highly recommend this place to friends and family."
Four,Great prices and great food! Loved the menu selections and the small plates that allowed us to try many different plates. The chili and mac and cheese was amazing! Really enjoyed the service and happy hour menu was awesome as well. \n\nCool ambiance and the service was great as well. Their drink selection is quite different as well which was awesome to get a little different tastes throughout the meal. \n\nWould go here much more often if I lived closer!
Four,"""This place has great food and great prices.\nA nice change from the typical Scottsdale fair and not your typical \hole in the wall\"""" restaurant. \nIt is clean, the staff is friendly, always the same guys there.\nThe menu is large, serving both traditional Mexican food as well as Burgers and fries and combinations of both.\nThe portions are big and the prices are small.\nEverything tastes fresh and great.\nFYI- The place is packed at lunch time with high school kids. There is usually a place to sit, but for whatever reason (the food, perhaps?), it seems to be the new daytime hangout."""""""
Four,"After reading Yelp reviews, I was looking forward to lunch here while in town for a conference.\n\nWhat a cool atmosphere!  We still couldn't figure out why it was so empty though!!  Still, we had great service for a party of 9, or maybe that was just because I made it a two martini lunch...nothin' wrong with that!!\n\nMy cravings for a delicious BLT were satisfied....and the gorgonzola and pistachio slaw was SO good...and I'm not usually a slaw fan...but wow it was tasty.\n\nhahaha, yes!  The bathrooms were quite an experience!!!  I didn't take the elevator though...but next time I will have to!"
Four,"It was good! Fresh Wasabi is an inexpensive, small, and simple restaurant. If I wanted amazing sushi then I wouldnt have gone there - I would have spent a $100 at an expensive sushi bar. BUT I was craving eel sauce and ginger and plain old sushi and I was on a budget- It was delicious and didnt disappoint for the amount of money I was spending. I spent $50 for my family of 4(2 kids and 2 adults)! We left stuffed. That included appetizers, sides, and sushi- 5 rolls. the Climax roll was my favorite. I will come again for a quick sushi trip!\n\nThey kept my kids happy and our waters full!! Thanks again."
Five,"I love this place! The Meatball sandwich is great and so are all the pastas. Completely authentic and not gross like a cheapy Italian Restaurant.\nEverything is good from the bread, to the meatballs, to the side salad. Order the half portion or full portion of all their menu items and it will not disappoint. Expect to wait a 1/2 or more for your food to arrive though, it will not be done quickly but it will be worth the wait. Call ahead if you are in a hurry! The desserts are also delicious, not to mention it contains a market with a surplus of Italian ingredients to make your own meal at home. Your Italian Grandma would be so proud!"
Five,"""We've lived right down the street from this restaurant for 2 years before we checked it out on Yelp and realized that we were definitely missing out on some great Mexican food!!\nAs soon as you walk in, you are seated quickly and they bring you some of the best chips and salsa that I've ever had in my life. And then they bring you refills of chips and salsa until you finally think that maybe you should stop and save some room for your actual meal.\nSo then when your food does get there, the first thing you'll think is \Holy crap that is a lot of food!\"""" But it is AMAZING. I have only ever had the carne asada burro, but I don't think I'll ever get anything else from here. It is a pillow-sized burro stuffed with chunks of steak, cheese and roasted bell peppers, onions and tomatoes. SO GOOD!! My husband has had a few of the other things and he swears that it is some of the best Mexican food that he's ever had, too. \nThe $1.75 margaritas are not bad, and they compliment the food really well. My whole meal was about $10, and I still had half of it leftover to take home!\nBesides the food, the service here is impeccable. The waiters are all very attentive to what you need and they are very polite and FAST!"""""""
Four,"Best pedi I've had in a very long time! My hubby, BFF and I needed a good pedi--and since I was warn out on the salon we'd been going to--it had been a while and I was seriously tired of my tootsies not coming out to play! \n\nEmily was my nail tech--she was absolutely fantastic. Took her time and was very meticulous even though it was late in the day and on 4th of July! My hubby and BFF both had a similar experience! Yes! \n\nThe ambiance is very spa-like--add the sugar scrub and hot stone massage and you'll be chillax'n in no time. Truth be told, I love this place! The test is on the next few visits--I'm hoping I've found our new home for my tootsies!"
Four,"This is already a place where the staff knows names of people coming in for a hot breakfast - I observed it this morning.  Demographics are mostly middle aged to retired folks, with the latter having a good time exchanging quips with their server.\n\nSizable outdoor seating exists here as well as good room inside with rather modern decor, including a curved bar for solo patrons looking for a quick breakfast.  Background music was on the quiet side.\n\nI enjoyed my 2 egg breakfast with hash browns & English muffin.  Pancakes were just alright though.  On the menu the omelettes sounded good, as well as some of the vegan options made with tofu and assorted veggies.  Breakfast served all day so I know I'll take advantage of that.\n\nSmall hiccup with my order but they took care of things like a good restaurant should and I was impressed.  They're new and still working out a few kinks.  This place has a lot of potential, and I'll be back for certain.  Good service & management who make things right is hard to find these days."
Five,"El Mesquite is an outstanding neighborhood spot where tradition meets plate- and the customers are the big winners. As others have mentioned, this is a neighborhood place, where everyone knows each other, and the servers work here forever.\n\nIf you need corporate clutter, fake ambiance, licence plates on the wall, etc. this is not a place for you. If you like authentic food, warm service and spicy tasty salsa, then grab a table, and tell your taste buds to buckle up.\n\nI first went to El Mesquite years ago when I worked downtown. I fell head over heals for their unique chips and addictive spicy salsa. Warning, it is hot, but it's not hot just to be hot, like other places (cough cough, Los Dos...).\n\nBeing that this is a Mexican restaurant, beloved by locals- you will hear Spanish, laughter, English, and sometimes a combo of  the three. I really do love El Mesquite, they put up with my crap Spanish, and you do not need to speak Spanish to be comfy at El Mesquite. \n\nAs others have said, when you arrive, you seat yourself, drinks, chips & salsa will be right behind you. Food is great here, and the price point is very good for the value and amount of food you get. I highly recommend the carne asada burro. I know right now America's Taco shop is reigning supreme, but if El Mesquite was near America's, there would be an epic battle because El Mesquite easily beats their carne asada. No bull!$%@.\n\nAlso amazing is their guacamole, unlike many places, El Mesquite doesn't put a bunch of filler ingredients to make the guac go farther. Jus tasty ingredients, and your mouth will be happy. I also want to recommend getting a quesadilla, they are really tasty and cooked to perfection.\n\nEnjoy your trip to El Mesquite, you will not be disappointed, and if you are like me, this place will be in your rotation for 'go to' places!"
Four,"My absolute favorite thing about summer in Scottsdale is that restaurants and hotels get SUPER cheap and do every night happy hours. Literally, best Happy Hour in South Scottsdale, by far. I originally wanted to eat at Culinary Drop Out, but the line was long and I was STARVING. Went into Wildfish, because even though I had never eaten there, and was left without my Bible of Yelp, I took a chance since I had eaten at its North Scottsdale, Big Brother location, Eddie V's, dozens of times. The menu is very similar to Eddie V's, but I would say, a bit trendier. Me and my man had appetizers and I had a $5 Mojito, and it was delicious. I had ahi tuna tar tar, a green salad with shrimp, shrimp cocktail, and by far, the best calamari I had ever had. It was like, salty, sweet, crunchy, and had cashews on it. I couldn't tell if I was eating calamari, or a dessert! Go for Happy hour FOR SURE. Great atmosphere, too..."
Five,"First of all, I'd like to say that the owners are wonderful people and it seems that everything they serve is handmade and from the heart! I ordered the chicken nachos as an appetizer. The chicken was cooked perfectly and the jalape\u00f1os were amazing! My entr\u00e9e was the carne asada, which I have heard of but when I was brought a plate with a thin steak on it I was a little confused. Oscar (the owner) came over to the table and explained the best ways to eat it, and it was absolutely delicious! The pinto beans were whole and once again were absolutely cooked to perfection. He brought out 3 different salsas for us as well. One was the house salsa, which was the perfect blend of spice and sweet. The other was a much hotter salsa that definitely creeps up on you! It takes about 4 seconds before it tears you up! The third was a tomatillo salsa that was green. I'm not sure how to explain it but it was very good. For dessert I had the fried ice cream and it was awesome! The service was spectacular, as we were promptly seated and the food came very quickly! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for great handmade Mexican food! Kudos to Cafe Posada!"
Four,"""Fair food, fair price, very nice folks!\n\nI took the kids here after a day at the Falcon Field Air Museum, they were hot, tired and hungry. After explaining (a few billion times) that this was not \fast food\"""" and the burger wouldnt fly into their mouths as we sped through a drive through, they settled down.\n\nHave I mentioned that my grandkids havent been taught much in the ways of \""""someplace different\""""? \n I'm working on that.\nThe space is nice, with a mixture of booths, tables and a counter in the front window. \nThe counter where you order overlooks a clean and shiny grill, with assorted pictures of the offerings for those that have trouble reading the menu board.\n\nWith that setup.. heres the rundown.\nI wanted to try a Chicago style dog, my grandson wanted a hamburger, and the granddaughter wanted a corn dog.\nThe hamburger was a fine if unremarkable version. Which was perfect, decent 1/4 Lb patty & Bun, melted american cheese, nice and tasty.\nThe corn dog was about the same as you would find anywhere, also good (especially for a 3 year old who doesnt like culinary suprises!)\n\nMy jumbo hot dog was good, the actual weiner and bun itself was extremely unremarkable, in fact, and I'm sorry to say, I rather prefer the hot dogs at Costco (not the buns though!) it tasted like a cheap beef weiner in a wonder bread roll.\nThe difference was the toppings, and thats what a Chicago hot dog is all about! \nIt had a small amount of tomato, pickle, peppers and mustard on it.  And I loved the fresh taste they gave it. Much crisper than heavy chili or cheese! My only desire would have been for it to have a heavier helping of the toppings, and in fact when I go back (which I will!) I'm going to request a foolish amount of toppings, I recomend anyone trying it for the first time, just dive right in and join me in ordering extra toppings, after all, thats the point of this style of dog!\nI ordered a chicago-style tamale because I had no idea such things existed. What I got was a microwave meat tamale that was indeed made in Chicago.\nIt was just a sad, sad beast. I'm sure it's a famous Chicago food, and beloved, and if I was raised there I would crave it, but to me, it was flavorless, soggy in the wrong way, and existed only so that people could drench it in chili and cheese, probably a hit at 7-11's, but not for me.\nHowever, at about $1, I was willing to try it, and glad I did, however I shall not be having that one again.\n \nWe ordered 3 fries, and two would have done! They load those baskets up! \nI would ask for them well done next time, just because I like a slightly crispier fry, but that a minor quibble, zero complains on the fries!\nOr anything, $15 for a mess of food, cooked to order, by a locally owned shop that cares. I'll certainly go back.\n\nThey also sell Gyro's, which I didn't try, even though I've been longing for a great gyro, and Italian sausage and steak sandwiches. I want to try those next."""""""
Two,"If you're looking for vegan, this is NOT the best in town.  Sure, everything is vegan, but it's lots of fake meats, some odd flavors, and horrific videos playing on the wall of vegan propaganda.  \n\nAs a vegan, I choose to eat my lunch without a side of animal-slaughtering videos.  The best thing on the menu: Mu Shu Vegetable appetizer (so good!).  If you're willing to spend a little more, venture over to True Food or even Whole Foods which have lots of vegan options."
One,"""They don't even make their own \fior di latte\"""", the extremely important gelato base that is at the heart of any serious, authentic gelato. Arlecchino down the street is like a gazillion times better! And, they are actually Italian!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nEven Italian tourists I've seen go into Arlecchino were like, practically in tears over the magnificent artistry of the super-quality, super delicious authentic concoctions they were tasting. So why do people go to less authentic places? Well, it's like this: if one has only ever tasted generic, inferior quality grocery store ice-cream from the supermarket, and has never tasted, say, Haagen Dazs, then one wouldn't know the difference. Well ragazzi, it's time to taste the real mccoy...just have to drive a few minutes down the street where their gelato really does hit the \""""g-spot\"""" (hehe!!)  :)\n\nNon mangiate mai le schifezze, santa pace!!"""""""
Five,"""My review for over easy is seriously delinquent...but hey...better late than never right? I will start by saying that every time I come in to Over Easy I feel like part of the family. The staff, as well as the owners are always in a good mood, but at the same time no one is ever \fake-nice\"""". Sometimes I come across a wait at the restaurant, however it never feels like the wait is long.\n\nI've had several different menu items, but my favorite is always the pancakes. I know, I know, simple but delicious!! I've never had a bad food experience here and thus every time I show up I know it's going to be good. Also, please note the coffee. I am a coffee-aholic, so good coffee in a joint is important to me and they definately have it. Always good, and always fresh. \n\nThe restaurant itself is small, with only a few tables inside, a patio and the counter by the register. What I love about Over Easy is that its laid back. Over easy is not trying to be trendy or pretentious in any way. It's breakfast people, let's not make this too complicated before noon."""""""
Four,"This is a great TJ Maxx for the Phoenix-metro region. The homegoods section is great, both for home organization and for equipping your kitchen, bathroom, office and whatever with high quality gadgets on a budget. Great bedding selections as well.\n\nThe women's and junior's clearance sections are amazing, and the general sales floor always has a good selection of current fashions for amazing TJ Maxx prices. \n\nMy best scores here have been some plus double-ply cashmere sweaters and sale dresses. And recently this store has been getting Zara Basics (delicious consumable fashions for cheaper than cheap)."
Four,"I have been to the Herb box for lunch  twice and have loved it each time. Located in the very chic DC ranch at Pima, the restaurant is best enjoyed if seated outside in the patio on a lovely March afternoon. \nThe mango lemonade is very soothing and the refills keep coming. Had the salmon with tsatziki and a side if the sweet potato chips . The salmon here is one of the best i have eaten and the chips are really addictive. \nI didnt have dessert this time around but have tried their graham cracker chocolate mousee before and its delicious. \nWould love to go back whenever the weather permits patio seating."
Four,"I really like this restaurant.  Drinks, appetizers, and deserts were all 5 stars.  Dinner was good, just not great.  I think they are guilty of just being a little over ambitious with there main selections.  I had the chirizo porchetta and it looked and sounded great, but it was just average....the pork was overcooked and dried out.  My wife had the swordfish veracruz and she liked it, but thought it was kinda boring.  Overall, still a very good experience, but not 5 stars.  I will go back though as the restaurant and ambience is beautiful and the service was superb."
Four,"""Referring  to Mickey's as a  \dive bar\"""" is like referring to Princeton as a \""""secondary school\"""".  Its a lazily, flaccid description for a bar with a fist-full of moxie.  Their Bloody Marys alone feature a fucking brawny-assed, gigantic totem pole of man-meat.  Well, not \""""man meat\"""", but meat-fit-for-a-man.  You get the point.  \n\nLook, the main point is that no \""""dive bar\"""" is gonna be serving yo ass peppers and salami in a $5 tomato Slurpee.  \n\nPeople often mistake \""""kitsch\"""" as \""""obsolete\""""  and these these are the type of people who would use the word \""""psych!\"""", and grease their side-hair back after swindling you into a fake low-five.  \n\nAnd i would like to agree with their lowly opinions of Mickey's, but then, I wouldn't want to be wrong also.\n\nIf you've ever been to Welcome to the Johnson's in the Lower East Side, and moreover, enjoyed yourself there, then Mickey's is your Arizona equivalent.  Think of it as, Welcome to the Merriweather's.  Scottsdale name, New York kitsch.  \n\nSo, their bar service is kinda tough, but once there, they have a kickass selection of brews both ironic and sincere.  You want an Old Style followed by a Boddington's?  Where else but Mickey's?\n\nTheir kitchen is open late, which, for the love of all that is holy, is impossible to find in this three-bedroom-two-bath-house of a town.\n\nEven better, their food is goooood.  I mean, heart palpitating good when you consider how delish bar food REALLY CAN be at 2 am.  No, it ain't Capital Grille, get over it, but their wings, fries, chix tenders, et all hit the f'ing spot when you've had too many Jamisons (or Jager/Patron shots for the resident middle schoolers).\n\nThey just recently seemed to have remodeled their patio, which looks really great, but lost most of its charm.  Still, space to move and a decent spot to smoke outside beats a macrame couch, or whatever, every day of the week.\n\nAnyway.  I like this place.  They lose a star for making me pay $3 for a pretty tame DJ and for hosting Ohio State functions.  Fuck em.  Go Horns."""""""

Three,"Some of the best Thai food I have had in Phoenix, and I have tried almost all of them. The downside is that the service is TERRIBLE! Even when I call for take out orders. I have never had someone be so rude to me on the telephone before, I asked a question if they had a certain dish and the lady said no and abruptly hung up on me. If you can fight your way through the rudeness on the phone, you are in for a treat with the food . . . or just go down the street to Old Town and go the Malee's. \nRUDE RUDE RUDE"
Three,"I'm working in Phoenix this week with another company guy, so we both looked on Yelp! and settled on Firebirds - a well rated restaurant in the Chandler Fashion District, close to the office we are working at.  On entering (early evening), we were greeted with a lovely smoky smell that tantalized.  Seating was immediate by a friendly hostess.\n\nThe restaurant has a relatively dark interior similar to many other steak houses.  I could hear the music, but it sounded like it was coming from another room.  They could have piped it in to the main room quietly so that it didn't have the distant echoy effect.\n\nMy dining companion ordered a strawberry lemonade that was served in a pint glass with a sugared rim.  There were slices of fruit inside and froth on top - evidence of its fresh taste.  I, as usual, ordered coffee and that was much more bitter than I like.  Dark roasts that have been left to heat too long always taste the same, and it isn't good.\n\nSince so many people liked the crab cakes, we ordered those for an appetizer.  To my mind, they had too much of a strong celery taste.  The spicy marmalade sauce that they came with complemented the crab cakes excellently.  The slaw had crispy tortilla strips in it and a nice light dressing - very tasty.\n\nOur ceasar salads arrived.  The usual romaine lettuce was well dressed and augmented by in-house made croutons (the bread also being baked in-house) and nice slices of parmesan cheese.  Unfortunately, the parmesan was the only salt component, so the salad was fairly flat.\n\nI ordered the Durango burger - a chile spiced affair with pepper jack cheese, fried onions and roasted garlic ranch dressing.  Unfortunately, despite the tantalizing smell when we entered the restaurant, there was no smokiness on the burger.  Nor was there any spice.  They grind the meat in-house, so the medium rare burger had a good texture ans taste to it.  However I wanted punch, and got none.\n\nMy dining companion ordered the smoke house burger with bbq sauce, applewood smoked bacon and grated cheddar cheese.  There was too much bbq sauce included, and the cheddar cheese was not melted.  The bacon was the highlight here.  He also had fries (whereas I opted to replace the fries with my salad).  The portion size on the fries could only be described as small, and the fries were left behind as unappetizing.\n\nOverall, an average place.  It's certainly a place I will go to again, but I'm likely to try other offerings in the area before I choose to go back."
Four,"""We were seated quickly even on a weekend night. The staff were friendly and attentive and the majority of whom were females wearing somewhat provocative white shirts bearing slogans such as \legalize marinara\"""" and \""""tastes like garlic.\"""" It kind of reminded me of the Italian food version of Hooters. \n\nFood and drinks arrived quickly and were good. Prices are a bit high for pizza and pasta, but the atmosphere made it enjoyable. They have a good selection of menu items which gives you lots of options. For dessert they have a pizza cookie topped with ice cream which is one of my favorites and reason enough to come here."""""""
Five,"My fiancee and I visited Lon's at the Hermosa on a Friday night in June to celebrate our anniversary and was a perfect location for a little romance under the calm, star-cloaked Arizona sky in a pocket of wilderness within the sprawling Phoenix metro. \n\nLon's provided one of the most inspired meals I've had in quite a while, beginning expeditiously with a world-class wine list, representative of various renowned grape-squeezing regions as the Pacific Coast, Italy, France, Argentina, Chile, Spain, Portugal, Australia and New Zealand.  After a quick consult with a very capable sommelier who spirited us with an impressive explanation of Portuguese reds, we agreed on a bottle on Golfo [?], which may or may not be the correct name, as it smartly inoculated us after two and a half glasses each.  Mmm!\n\nIn place of a starter, we ordered two unique salads: Mine was a seared duck salad on baby greens with toasted pine nuts an a white vinaigrette.  It was ingenious ... but not quite as ingenious as the scallop salad my fiancee had.  They were absolutely the best-prepared scallops either of us had ever experienced.\n\nWhat is even more amazing is that the salads were surpassed in flavor by the entrees, which sometimes flops as a headliner to gourmet starters.  Not the case here.  My sun dried tomato crusted rack of lamb was prepared excellently and the crust paired with the tender, juicy lamb chops (4) was easily skyrocketed into the top 3 list of things I've ever tasted.  The goat cheese herb grits were a perfect, and light compliment .. and something I've truly never seen on a menu before, much less experienced by taste.  \n\nMy fiancee's grilled filet of salmon with blackberry barbeque glaze was very much an original as well.  Even for someone who is not a gigantic fan of salmon, such as myself, really enjoyed the complexity of flavors.  She very much enjoyed it.\n\nFor dessert, we had the sorbet sampler as a means of cooling off from our frenetic eating/drinking pace.  Although very delicious, it was a mistake on my part as there was a sampler of tiramasu/creme brulee/pote de chocolate.  Ugh.  What was I thinking bypassing this delicious plate of hyperglycemia?  Well, there's always next time.\n\nIt also must be noted, the stellar service we received.  The server was absolutely charming, gracious, and accommodative, referring to us by name, refilling our water/wine glasses, and supervising small touches like fetching the sommelier and informing the pastry chef that it was our anniversary [with that information, they gave us a chocolate script 'Happy Anniversary' on our dessert plate - nice touch].\n\nOverall, it was a place worthy of a very special occasion, and one which I would not hesitate to return to so that we can experience the rest of their impressive menu."
Five,"This was definitely the best pizza I have ever experienced and I have had great pizza in LA, NY, and various cities in Italy. I came to AZ for four days and I ended up eating here two of those days. I waited over 2 hours the first time and four hours the second time. It was well worth the wait. All of the ingredients were the best quality, the crust was thin yet soft, and the bread was awesome. I ended up trying four different pizzas and all were amazing. The wait is bearable if you drink at the bar next door or the English pub across from it. You can call at intervals to check back for the approximate wait time, so you can venture out pretty much anywhere in the area while you wait. Just make sure to get there a 1/2 hour before you get called in. And make sure you go with people you enjoy hanging out with for more than a short while!"

Two,"Breakfast options in the central corridor are alarmingly sparse, which creates irrational decisions like visiting 5th Avenue Cafe to percolate in your brain, brewing as a 'good idea'.  It is not.\n\nWhat seems like would be a local Denny's knock off except with mahogany trim and a full bar was more like a Mel's Diner without the boorish, but hilarious short-order cook and a tad dirtier.  My fiancee's veggie breakfast was frightful and dry while my I found myself surrendering to the French toast offensive.  No amount of store-bought syrup could conquer that alpine mountain of suck.  Somehow, i don't think this is what France had in mind when they lent the moniker to breakfast heaven.  They need to rename them Freedom Toast, as in, set these things free in the front asphalt parking lot so the hospital pigeons can feast.\n\nThe ambiance is absolutely laughable at best.  In every available sight line are TV [one was one of those old-school rear projector behemoths on a ledge] set to CNN just in case you want to know the weather in Duluth as you fight your chewy bacon.\n\nCoincidentally, there is the hospital across the street, convenient for an outpatient stomach pump should the need present itself."
Four,"Love the food... Love it. When you can walk-in to a restaurant and feel cleaner walking out, they've done a good job. I had the carrot-coconut soup, golden hummus, and I had pesto foccacia with nut cheese, and a gorgeous salad with yellow bell peppers, mint, tomatoes, carrots, cucumbers, and spring mix. This was fresh and wonderful.\n\nThe raw vegan shooters were tasty! Try them. I forgot which one my fianc\u00e9 got, but I stole a sip and it was lovely. They sub in nut cheese for any dairy cheese, and serve teas and a lot of raw foods. My fianc\u00e9 got the raw zucchini alfredo that was amazing (you know I stole some!!).\n\nThen we went to the market that it's adjoined with... For items you can buy at Whole Foods and Sprouts, they GOUGE. 2 ounces of goji berries for $14!? I can get them at a health food store for $20 for a POUND, 8 times that!\n\nGo there for the food, specialty teas, and maybe some tinctures. But don't get your normal stuff there."
Four,"I had my daughter delivered by Dr. Scott Schapker at Bethany Women's Healthcare and was pleased with the level of care I received. They have a birthing center on-site if you're looking for a more natural/alternative birthing experience and even have the big bathtubs for water births. \n\nThey're also affiliated with Phoenix Baptist Hospital if you're not down with the whole birthing center/midwife thing, which is a nice little hospital IMO. They also have the ultrasound center at the office as well as regular OB/GYN services. The office isn't fancy, but the entire staff is super nice and I had a great experience for being a first-timer. \n\nThey offer a bunch of classes for new parents that I would recommend and they're extremely reasonable. If you're up in this part of town and looking for an OB/GYN I would check them out. Dr. Schapker (both father and son) and extremely caring and were very kind to me."
Four,"""Five Guys versus In-N-Out Burger - the competition is on. \n\nFive Guys is a terrific burger and fries chain that started back east and has continued to branch out over the USA. It's only recently hit AZ. Word spread quickly and Five Guys has become a phenomenal success around here. If you want to spark a lively discussion, ask someone which they prefer: Five Guys or In-N-Out. It's an East Coast versus West Coast thing, yo. LOL \n\nFive Guys serves two sizes of burgers. The \little burger\"""" is the size of a normal burger. Their \""""regular\"""" burger is actually TWO patties. Not realizing this, on my first visit, I ordered the regular size. I couldn't finish it, so it must really be big. When you place your order, you tell them what you want on your burger. Of course they offer the usual cheese and condiments, but they offer other choices too. Almost anything you want: bacon, grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, jalapenos, BBQ sauce and more. \n\nTheir fries are good too, thickly cut and well-seasoned. They serve them in a brown paper bag. I like to add a salt packet to the whole bag and shake it around before spreading the fries out on the table. I prefer my fries a bit overdone, so when ordering I ask for them to be prepared extra crispy. Really good. \n\nI'd be remiss if I didn't comment on their brand new soda dispensing machine. I've never seen anything like it. (see pic) It's only got one actual dispenser, but you press the computer screen to select your beverage choice. Then it offers you the choice of adding special flavoring like lemon, vanilla, power boost, etc. The employee guys in the back said it's an urban legend that if you punch in a secret code of ingredients, then alcohol is dispensed. Pretty funny."""""""
Three,"""I bought a Facial + 50min Massage Groupon ($79) for the Beauty Scene and redeemed my voucher this past weekend. I always read Yelp reviews before buying massage/facial Groupons just to make sure my purchase will be worth it and after reading these reviews, I thought it would be totally worth dishing out the $79 + tip. Well I'm here to tell you it was ok.\n\nUpon arrival, it did seem like it was going to be a super great experience; it is located in a nice plaza up in the Greyhawk area. The lobby was really nice and the staff was friendly. First I had to fill out the standard new client paperwork and then I was greeted by my massage therapist. It was a really relaxing massage, but the pressure was more on the lighter side. (Interesting: I put 'medium pressure' on the paperwork up front, it made me wonder if I should have put hard?) The massages also come with a foot scrub and that was awesome. She did, however, use oil and not lotion during the massage, so afterwards my hair looked like it was wet - something to keep in mind if you are looking to run errands afterwards. \n\nNext I had my facial. I had to wait in the little hallway for about 2minutes while the person getting a facial before me changed clothes, came out, and then they had to put new sheets on the bed. Kind of awkward but it was fine. The facial was ok, I have definitely had better. They didn't use a Clarisonic and I feel like they don't have as many products as other salons do. (Interesting: on the last step of the facial she said \and here's some sunscreen\"""" as she was putting it on my face. It made me wonder back to the paperwork, on the question \""""do you usually wear sunscreen?\"""" I circled yes, but that doesn't mean that I want a layer of that on my face at the end of my facial).\n\nOverall, it was a nice relaxing experience but not my favorite."""""""
Four,"Spending time in this area with other people make it a lot more bearable. Something else that makes it bearable-Yelping good food. \n\nMy mom was leaving this morning and she wanted me to look up a good place for breakfast. We settled on Crackers & Co Cafe because it was close to her friend's house and we could pick her up. On the way over, though, my mom saw people were waiting outside and dropped me off so I could start waiting--good thinking! They took my name and told me it would be about 15 minutes.\n\n20 minutes later, my mom and her friend arrived just as my name was called. We were seated promptly in a corner table under the some windows, with convenient view of 2 flat-screen televisions, both broadcasting CNN. A little distracting but whatever. \n\nWe were seated around 11 AM and by then my mom and I were no longer in the mood for breakfast foods. My mom's friend started with a Mango Iced Tea and I got the Strawberry Peach Iced Tea. They came quickly but tasted like something from a fountain or mix; very sweet and cool, but almost no tea-taste. They tasted fine, but I'm not sure that it was actually a fresh iced tea as it said on the menu. \n\nWe ordered: \n\nHalf-sandwich and soup: My mom got half a roast beef and provolone on wheat sandwich, with a bowl of Clam Chowder (usually only on Fridays but it was the Soup du Jour today). The roast beef was sliced very thin but there was a good amount, so much that my mom deconstructed her sandwich. The beef had a good texture but the sandwich overall was pretty bland. The clam chowder was delicious, thick and creamy but somehow still appropriate for a warm day because of the huge chunks of clams and mealy potato. Add a little Cholula and I'm all there (stole a lot of spoonfulls, actually).\n\nBelgian Waffle: My mom's friend asked if the toppings were fresh and the waitress answered honestly that the blackberries and blueberries were frozen but the strawberries were fresh. It came hot off the griddle with butter and a good amount of topping, but no syrup--we had to ask and someone else, I believe a manager, brought it over promptly. \n\nThe Californian - I'm eating the leftovers of this sandwich as we speak.. which is roasted chicken breast, red onions, sprouts, avocado, tomato, and mayo on whole wheat bread. It was served with some really delicious fries; very crispy with a difficult to describe crustiness to it. Trust me, very good. The sandwich had a lot of flavor but you want to eat the pickle that comes with it for sure, to bring it together. I should've asked for mustard to be added but forgot. (Also, I just want to know why California-style food is associated with avocado? I love me some avo but it's not like Californians put it on their steak and in their drinks or something.) \n\nOverall, the food was pretty good for the price, the service attentive, and the place busy but still conducive to pleasant conversation. Oh, and free refills on the drink. Hopefully I'll get another chance to eat here before I leave."
Three,"We had a fairly nice visit to Lao's the other night. The service was wonderful, they treated us like royalty. \n\nFoodwise, I found it  a little mediocre...at least the dish I had. I shared a seafood plate with my husband and I also ordered the family hot pot. The seafood was actually pretty fresh tasting, especially the shrimp, but everything else just seemed a little bland, lacking in a flavor. \n\nI heard some positive comments on the orange chicken from others at the table; and the mongolian beef seemed to be a hit, and everyone was very happy with the shrimp fried rice. \n\nAll in all the food was ok, but not necessarily worth the drive (at least from where I am)."
Five,"Loral has been integral in helping me to launch a new product line.  She's bent over backwards to make sure we launched with success, and when I stopped by to see our product, she had created such an eye catching display.  I've seen her interact with other vendors as well, and she treats them all like celebrities.  Her whole focus is the greater good and building community.  Everything I've ever seen at ecocentricity! follows through on those missions.  If you're looking for a unique gift, she's the kind of business owner it's important to support.  She's actively seeking them out and bringing them together in a great, one-of-a-kind store."
Five,"""This place is literally the only place my boyfriend and I order from for Chinese food.\n\nWe probably get delivery from Wongs once a week, and the delivery guy remembers us every time!  There was a weekend we didn't order because we were out of town.  The next weekend when we did order, the delivery guy said, \we didn't hear from you guys last weekend!\""""  Haha!  They're always really fast; 20 minutes from the time we call to the time they're at the door is average.  Always!\n\nThe food here is amazing.  I would figure that their prices should be way more considering the AMOUNT of food you get.  We always have leftovers (and everyone knows leftover chinese is even better the next day.)  I'm also a very picky eater and they've never given me grief when I've asked for substitutions, nor have they ever messed up an order.  Plus, they'll give you complimentary egg rolls!\n\nAs far as the restaurant itself goes?  It's ghetto looking on the outside!  Last time we drove by there was graffiti on it I believe.  They're slowly but surely making it look more maintained (working neon signs, signs in their windows, etc.) but, whew.  Don't let that hold you back.  You step inside and it's got a flat screen TV usually with some sports event on.  Many tables/booths.  They also sell home made jewlery in the restaurant which is different.  Very clean and maintained.  Professional and friendly staff.  They also serve alcohol in the restaurant!\n\nSo, yes...love Wongs."""""""
Three,"Let me start off with two words GIOVANNI SAUCE!! What is this amazing sweet spicy tangy wonder that is covering my wings. Pure heaven is what it is. That's why I keep coming back to this place, it's not my typical place I would hang, I am not much of a super loud sports bar type of gal but when I get that sauce stuck in my head I have to have a fix. last time we went the waitress made us give her a credit card before we could eat and I thought that was weird."

Three,"""With over \10,000 combinations\"""", there is a burger here for everyone - that is the motto here.   Indulge isn't a boutique burger joint.  You can have a burger as simple as pickles tomatoes onions and ketchup, or you can venture into the unknown with brioche cranberry chutney gruyere and turkey.  It is build your own, or sample one of their signatures.\n\nI am a snacker, so I liked that the experience starts off with a sampling of their garlic parmesan chips. What would make these perfect would be a dusted Parmesan, or melted Parmesan with white truffle oil.  Currently, the way they are prepared and presented is a poor foreshadowing of what is to come.\n\nBuild your own burger is great. It's like a sushi menu for burgers. On the menu, one marks their selections with penicl. Choices go from A-F. Chooose your protein, (salmon, Kobe, turkey, etc) cheese, (Danish bleu cheese, herb goat cheese spread, gruyere) bun, (brioche, English muffin, wheat) sauces, (apricot chipotle, aioli, cranberry chutney, Bangkok peanut sauce, cactus ranch, honey citrus pepper, and more) regular toppings, (baby greens, roasted chiles, boiled egg slices, pineapple, grilled onions) and indulge toppings (avocado, fried egg, chili con carne, honey cured bacon, and more).\n\nKids have a four item menu that includes a peanut butter and jelly wrap.\n\nIt is very important that I record the appetizer list here.  Essentially, it is what would otherwise come with a standard burger.  Happy hour patrons and ladies are lured by the 1/2 appetizers offerings here, but there is not variety.  There is starch, more starch, carbohydrates, beans and protein, or a small side salad.  *shakes head.*\n\nAppetizers:\nSweet potato fries\nFried dill pickle chips\nOnion strings and regular fries\nChili\nSide salad\n\nI think vegetarians or \""""healthy\"""" eaters will still find something for their palates here, such as the salad with Bleu cheese, strawberries, and walnuts.  There is also a grilled veggie pesto sandwhich on the menu, as well as the Veggie homemade burger. (fresh ingredients blended in special sauces including herbs, spices, beans, and rice)\n\nSandwhiches:\nBlackened or grilled grouper\nFried bologna\n3 cheese\n\nThere is a list of signature burgers, and I chose the first one on the list, the \""""Vesuvius volcanic,\"""" the specially cooked burger with molten cheese. It arrived perhaps 15 minutes later, a la carte.  FYI, none of the burgers or signature sandwhiches come with fries.  I like that those fries aren't there to distract me, it's why I never finish a burger in a restaurant.\n\nHence, I was actually able to finish my volcanic burger.  The unique aspect of it is that molten American cheese is inside of the meat patty. You take that first bite intoo your burger, and the hot molten cheese comes bursting out. Downside is that this is the only kind of cheese that so lovingly melts inside the pattie. Not a fan of American cheese. It tastes like that plastic pseudo cheese made from oil and water - that you used to eat as a fun snack when you were a kid.  Well, it is no longer fun, and I think it somewhat spoils the taste of the burger.\n\nThe Downside of burgers not coming with fries...you are still paying between 10-12 dollars for a burger, without the generous side of potatoes.\n\nService was friendly and attentive, but slow like others have mentioned.  Places like this I recommend sitting at the bar.\n\nOverall, it is an A-OK.  The concept is great, the burger patties are very generous and well prepared.  I think the prices are higher than they need to be, and this place just doesn't set itself apart from other places of its kind.  Burger adventurers may enjoy this place more than myself, as there are some unique additions you can make to an otherwise standard burger.\n\nSee quick tips for happy hours and ladie's night specials."""""""
Five,"Per my original review, it's time for a quick update of Illume Photography... \n\nJust as I presumed, I am 100% pleased with the pictures from our wedding weekend... we were given a choice of getting the proofs in individual printed photo format vs. in book format.  We chose book format and we now have 2 beautifully bound books full of incredible photos from the weekend.

Four,"This is the place to eat breakfast food if you're looking for a hip, trendy restaurant in the Arcadia area.  It can get a little busy so I suggest coming during the transition time.  Your best bet is mid morning when the white hairs leave and the sun glass wearing twenty-somethings start arriving.\n\nThe food is very good and definitely not fancy.  You're here to get your morning fill and feel cool at the same time.  Prices aren't bad and would be worth it for a little wait, but not worth it waiting for an extended amount of time.\n\nAll in all if you're into cool breakfast joints this whould be on your list."
Four,"Qcumberz is a pretty cool place, despite the cheesy name. They have loads and loads of junk, intermixed with hidden gems. So it takes some searching and sifting to find the prizes... it's definitely not a 10-minute endeavor. You will get dirty, dusty, and, if it's May through October, hot and sweaty. Qcumberz is kind of like Sage for people without fistfuls of expendable income and with tons of time... I furnished (using that term loosely) much of my 1950s condo with items from Qcumberz on a grad student's pittances. The parking situation totally blows there, but you do get the opportunity to flip off the protestors at the neighboring Planned Parenthood clinic, so maybe it all balances out?"
Three,"While I reserve the right to upgrade this my gut is 3.5 stars rounded down Thanks yelp. \n\nService: \n5 stars, granted there were only us and 2 others for a short time.

They Flat Grill (fry) a hand pattied 1/2lb burger and serve it with mayo, mustard, 1000 Island, let and tom. While it was not over cooked it was too thin to cook med rare.

Five,"""Honestly, if I were to have paid for this room I might have only given it 4 stars.  But, I happen to have a friend who travels to resorts around the country for work, and when he told me he would be staying at the Phoenician and invited me to be his guest for the weekend, I was pretty much all about it.  He worked about 12 hours a day while I lounged around the pool, took bubble baths in the huge hotel bathroom, and drank wine in bed while waiting for him to get off so I could show him around Scottsdale.  It was like \Pretty Woman\"""" except instead of sexual favors, I paid for my stay with extensive local knowledge and amusing witty banter.\n\nWe were in the main building, where the rooms are very decently sized, and the bathrooms are pretty damn huge.  The grounds are gorgeous, and the close-but-not-too-close to Old Town Scottsdale location makes it ideal for having a night out without worrying about a $40 cab ride to get back to your secluded resort hotel. \n\nThere were a couple things I would change about the room. For one thing, I wasn't a huge fan of the beds. For what I imagine would normally be a $250+/night stay, I've had better.  It was a nice bed, for sure, but not as opulently luxurious as an Arizona Biltmore or Royal Palms, in my opinion. Also, the bathroom had a lighted magnifying cosmetic mirror, which is awesome, but it protruded from the wall at exactly 5'5\"""" from the ground, and wasn't adjustable. So, it would be perfect for A. 5'5\"""" women and B. Pete Wentz. But if you're 5'2\"""" like me, it was pretty useless.\n\nThe pool was actually really relaxing. No DJ and drunk partiers were at a minimum as well. I also appreciate that they bring out pitchers of water to everyone without the stupid \""""bottle or tap\"""" question (which obviously comes with the obligatory eye roll when you're fine with not paying $12 for something that comes out of a toilet for free) . The service was a little spotty.  We called it \""""leisurely\"""" but some might call it slow. Plus, somehow my card got charged twice, once for my real amount and once for a completely different amount, which probably means the server accidentally ran my card for somebody else's tab, so hopefully that falls off my bank account before posting. At $7/beer, I can't really afford to pay for anyone's drinks but my own.\n\nAll in all, I would give it 4.5 stars, but I had a great weekend with great company and the fact that I didn't have to go the Vivian Ward route to get it (though I still got the bubble bath) made it even better, so I'm rounding up to 5."""""""

Three,"Im in Phoenix for work and like to try local places, but gave in on my walk as I past the Hard Rock Cafe. It was around lunch time, 11ish and I decided to eat. It was pretty empty and a typical hard rock, but the selection was ok. I was craving a burger and got their burger. The night before, I was craving mac and cheese and when i saw it on the menu, I was so happy. I ordered a side. My server was great btw. \n\nThe burger was ok, nothing special. It wasnt very juicy, and they didnt provide much more than a piece of lettuce tomato and mustard and ketchup. Overall pretty boring and non-cravable. The mac and cheese, however was great. It had red pepers with a little kick. \n\nIt was a chain, been to one, you know what to expect."

I resisted buying a hot pink pan, now I'm sort of kicking myself for not getting it. \nMy only gripe is the shoe selection was seriously lacking and the check out process is weird at best. You stand in line and whenever a cashier becomes available a flashing light and prerecorded voice comes on announcing which lane will serve you. It was slightly creepy to say the least."""""""

Two,"I just don't get Dunkin' Donuts.  Maybe it is because I've been spoiled by the deliciousness that is Rainbow Donuts - or maybe it is just because Dunkin's donuts are just total crap.  \n\nWe happened to be in this area today, and got a few donuts to fulfill my sugar craving.  Their chocolate donuts are brown, but they don't actually taste like chocolate.  They were some of the blandest donuts I've ever eaten.  The pink-frosted sprinkled donuts were marginally better, but the apple fritter was a waste.  \n\nI am so glad I live by a REAL donut shop, so I don't have to resort to these low-quality, flavorless, tiny donuts on a regular basis.  If you are within 30 minutes of a Rainbow donuts, make the trip - you'll be glad you made the effort for fresh, flavorful treats."
Two,"Always willing to give a new beer place a try.  I had heard that Nimbus had opened in the old Taberna site, and thought I would stop and see what it was.   I was really surprised, because I had heard such good things about Nimbus in Tucson, so maybe I was expecting to much.  The interior had little or no character.  I sat at the bar, and the bartender seemed bored and uninterested. I asked about the different types of beer, and she really had no idea how to describe them.  I ordered a draft of one to try, and then she handed me a menu - which actually had beer descriptions on it. It would have been nice to see that, prior to ordering.\n\nThat said, the beer was good, but not so good as to override the lack of ambience, and the average service."
Four,"Been trying to check out local places in downtown vs. giving my moolah to a national chain & I have to say Carly's Bistro is a jewel! I love the restaurant it's location is great & the bartender is fun & interactive. We stopped in on a weekday after dinner time & every seat was taken but at the bar. Good... no, a great sign. I had the Prosciutto Grilled Sandwich aka panini that was as good as a panini I've ever had. I'm normally not a fan because they are saturated with some kind of oil, butter or what have you. But this was just excellent. I can go for days on why I loved it but just take my word this is the best grilled sandwich I've had. The man next to me at the bar ordered the orozo salad to go after he ate his entire entree. That again was another sign to order the orzo salad as my side & I was not disappointed. It was just what I needed with my salty, crispy, sweet sandwich. It was fresh & the ingrediants were on parr. Washed this down with the bartenders suggestion of beer (which I can't remember which Four Peaks it was but it wasn't the usual suspects ... something wheat berry something) which was good as all Four Peaks beer is. \nThe hubs ordered the Pastrami Grilled Sandwich & it was good. Unlike most of his orders this was pretty big especially being a grilled sandwich. I'm sure if it hadn't been grilled or a panini it would have been pretty big. So kudos to the hubs on this order & Carly's for rocking out the best grilled sandwich I've ever had & a great bartender to boot."
Four,"I've only had lunch here, but I am impressed. \n\nI ordered Tom Yum, even though it wasn't on the lunch menu. The wait staff was attentive but not overbearing.

My friend ordered green curry, and she said it was delicious. \n\nThe Tom Yum had the usual mushrooms, carrots and lemongrass flavoring. This one also had some peppers and broccoli added. I ordered rice with it, and everything was very tasty and the spice was just right. Also the price was just right. I was expecting a $10-12 meal ticket, and they only charged $4.95 for the soup & rice!"
Two,"Went for restaurant week last night. Not very impressed. Both my wife and I had the same thing and our friends tried other items. We started with the spinach salad which of the three ordered only one was somewhat satisfied. Small portion and dressing was weak. The other person had lobster bisque that he felt was good.\n\nFor entree, two hanger steak orders that were again small in portions. Mine was almost sent back (now that I think about it I should have) because it was very tough and that after being served sliced. My wife said hers was tender. Other entrees were the drumsticks with mac & cheese (satisfying) and the mystery meat dish that was a piece of beef that was buried in mash potatoes, literally. Half order. Tasty but the meat was hard to find. \n\nDessert was the farina with apple dish (different, just OK), tres leche cake (very good) and apple cobbler, again good but small portion.\n\nService was good but very slow, dessert took forever and the getting the check also took too long. When they delivered the coffee we were told that they ran out of spoons. Same with dessert, no spoons. I have to say we were not impressed and not sure we will return anytime soon."
Five,Here is another fine example of Phoenix splendid public works.This building is a vibrant hub of human interaction and learning. There is free Wifi throughout the building with plenty of well lit desks complete with a place to plug in your power supply. There are also public computers for anyone who has a library card and a little patience as there is a time limit\nand a place for users to line up when all the 30 - 40+ computers are all in use. See for yourself. It's free fun for everyone. Our Tax Dollars the way they should be spent!!!
One,"""THE OWNER LITERALLY STEPPED IN FRONT OF ME, BLOCKED MY PASSAGE, GOT IN MY FACE, AND CONFRONTED ME. \n\nSorry for how long this is, but I hope you take the time to read it. \n\nIf my phone wasn't so slow, I would've posted this review while actually sitting inside Kokomo. I'm actually still upset just thinking about this experience, because I've never had a \business owner\"""" be so rude to me. I was meeting up with an old friend I haven't seen in a while in the shopping center that Kokomo is in, and I saw it and we decided to go have some frozen yogurt. Upon entering and staring at the choices for a while, I saw that there are small sample cups up by the register. I'm usually an icecream type of person, so I was wanting to make sure I actually chose a flavor that I liked. I don't know about everyone else, but I'm not going to spend my money on a cup of frozen yogurt that I end up not even liking. Also, at the normal icecream shops, you can sample basically as many as you want.\n\nSo, after having 3 samples (cheesecake, cake batter, and chocolate), I saw that they had raspberry pomegranate. I went back to get another sample cup, and upon walking back to the yogurt machines, the owner literally stepped right in front of me, blocked my passage, (\""""got in my face\"""", if you will), and confronted me by saying \""""Are you serious, how many samples have you had?\""""\n\nI was extremely taken aback, because that is not only the most unprofessional, but also the RUDEST, I have ever had an employee, let alone business owner speak to me before. I told him this was going to be my 4th sample, and he scoffed and started waving his hands around acting as if I had been trying to steal his product by only getting samples. He told me as a business owner he can't have people \""""just sitting around all day eating free samples.\""""\n\nI'm not a business owner...but here's a suggestion. How about saying \""""Just so you know, we have a sample limit of 3-4 per person. My personal favorite is _______, and if you like cheesecake, definitely try the cheesecake fro-yo with graham cracker crumbs!\""""\n\nOn top of this, he had also stopped my friend right before he stopped me, again by getting up in her space and physically blocking her from walking anywhere. \n\nSince when is it ever okay to be that confrontational and invade someone's space like that?\n\nHe embarrassed me in front of the entire store and treated me so badly that I'm extremely surprised he actually still has a business. Had my friend not already gotten a cup of frozen yogurt, I would have walked out. This is completely unacceptable.\n\nIf he was so upset about people taking samples, then maybe he shouldn't have the cups free for the taking. Make it so that you have to ask a cashier for a sample cup.\n\nAlso, calling yourself a \""""business owner\"""" during the same interaction where you get in my face, try to block my way to my seat, confront me in such a rude way, and then don't even let me speak because you're too busy scolding me with your hands on your hips as if you're a mother yelling at a child- is laughable and makes me wonder if you are actually that clueless about customer service."""""""
Four,"I know its gonna sound a bit foolish when I divulge that I was actually a bit scared to enter the Roadrunner Lounge, but the truth is that I was.  Due to its lack of windows and barebones facade, I concluded that this bar had the possibility of being the sort of place where, when I opened the door, I might bare witness to a mob boss or two trying to decide what they should do with the man they just shot...  but that wasn't the case.\n\nWhat I discovered was a long corridor flanked by mirrored walls and strings of multicolored lights, as well as ample seating and classic video games to boot.  The games included PacMan and Golden Tee, accompanied by a dartboard and a pool table - enough to keep the gamer in any of us busy for at least a few hours of drink-sippin.\n\nThe drinks were cheap and strong, and the tunes were decent - however the digital jukebox put a frown on my face; I hoped for a Wurlitzer.  Our barkeep was friendly and efficient, and our drinks were strong and low-priced.  I think tap beer's only two bucks, and mixers aren't too much more.\n\nIn conclusion, the next time you're feeling a bit nostalgic, and you're looking for a watering hole off the beaten path, kick a few back at the Roadrunner.  Bottom's up!"
Five,"""NOFX said \Never Trust A Hippy\""""...\n\nWonder if Fat Mike ever had a burger here? Because I'd definitely put my trust in these hippies as they know how to make a mean, mean burger. \n\nI was seriously blown away by this place on my first and only visit here. It's funny because my trip here was in due to a few factors. One, I was on my way back to the west side of the valley (Avondale) where my brother lives, after a day of disc golfing in Scottsdale and Fountain Hills. My original eating destination was closed and in a \""""Plan B\"""" move, I bust out my Yelp App and this place came up as the first suggestion. And with a name like Two Hippies Gnarly Burger Joint...it was a must see and must taste. \n\nThe look of the place definitely fits the name. Walking in, you see a hodgepodge of 60s psychedelia, vinyl records, VW bus toys and pictures of classic rockers like Frank Zappa, Jerry Garcia and The Rolling Stones. The menu hangs behind the counter, all done up on a chalkboard. There's even a back room called \""""The Man Cave\"""" where you can drop in, tune out and pig out amongst vinyl records and other pictures. \n\nIt's a build-your-own burger joint where the list of toppings is pretty extensive. You also don't have to do a burger...you can do chicken, portobello mushroom or even cheese steak. And you also have a choice of bun as well...the name of the game here is CHOICE! \n\nThey also do various flavors of lemonade...with at least 7-10 favors to choose from. \n\nFor this visit, I went with a burger with sauteed mushrooms, lettuce, tomato, mustard, guacamole, Swiss cheese on an onion roll. This came with a side of their beer battered onion rings. I also tried one of their peach lemonades. I was able to use my Yelp check-in discount and got my lemonade for half price. Score! \n\nSo where to start??? The burger was messy but heavenly!!! Super fresh ingredients and while I thought upon ordering that my burger was going to be a bit too \""""busy\"""" with all kinds of different flavors, it worked nicely. The onion rings were super light and the actual onions were fresh. The lemonade was refreshing, especially after a day playing golf in the hot Arizona sun. I pretty much destroyed my meal...I mean I SLAMMED it! \n\nI decided to take another lemonade for the road and Sherl (one of the managers, along with her husband) laid on a \""""MYSTERY\"""" lemonade to me in order to see if I would be able to guess it....\n\nAnd sure enough, I got it right...and the first person to correctly identify the flavor. So if you are intrigued by this review, go in for a burger...some onion rings...talk to Sherl (she is super nice, very friendly and personable)...take in the \""""groovy\"""" atmosphere and try to guess the \""""Mystery\"""" lemonade (or any of the other lemonades)...I guarantee you will not be disappointed. \n\nAnd to tell the truth, this place is so good I'm really wishing Phoenix was only a few hour drive away...it's that good!"""""""
Five,"I cannot believe I haven't reviewed this place! I love the Lost Leaf. It's rare that my husband and I ever get out without the kiddos, but when we do, Lost Leaf is almost always on the agenda. It's such a laid back vibe, we can't help but really enjoy ourselves.\n\nI love that the music is in a different area so you're not so crowded when you sit down to have a drink. And for how small the place is, it's surprisingly roomy once you get inside. LOVE the art on the walls and the crowd is always great. I feel like the limited beer and wine menu keeps the frat boys out and the 'normals' in. Major perk. We usually have an Ace Pear, grab a table, and chit chat with all of our friends. I really love this place, I'm happy to see it flourish."
Five,"Sigh. I am in love.\n\nWhat can be better than brunch/lunch in a quaint historic home adorned with kitschy antiques? Nothing! The answer is nothing.\n\nWe went here for a late lunch one Saturday, and it hit the spot. It was perfect. We all fell in love with the adorable house and its wooden floors, unique furniture and abundance of natural daylight. Our server was quite friendly and pleasant, and she let us take our time while also suggesting menu options.\n\nWe started with 3 sticky buns - a little rich for me, but very indulgent and sinful. Yum. My husband then moved on to a cheeseburger, which was very tasty. My friend ordered the turkey sandwich, which was bigger than big. I ordered a cup of soup and a half chicken salad sandwich. All of it was very satisfying and super filling. Of course, we couldn't pass on dessert, so we tried the bread pudding. Simply fabulous.\n\nI am dying to go back for brunch...I'd love to try an omelet and mimosa here. I've heard the wait is bad, but we were seated immediately at 1:30pm on a Saturday. After living among the land of the strip mall in North Scottsdale, Coronado Cafe was a much needed and welcome change!\n\nAny place that makes me feel like I am back in New Orleans will win my heart, and Coronado Cafe did just that."
Five,"I'm straight. It's my cross to bear. \n\nAnd as I texted my friend tonight, it takes a comfortable heterosexual male to venture to a gay bar alone. I go almost every Monday night. I love Bao the nail guy. God, I hope that's his name. I love the Martinis. Try the rose tea martini. Like nothing else. \n\nHere's the most impressive part of Amsterdam for me personally. I have gone there regularly on Monday nights and a very occasional Friday or Saturday nights and I've never been hit on. Not one time. I attribute this to one of two potential reasons: I'm hideous and shouldn't venture out in public or these dudes have really good gaydar. Either way, I've never been uncomfortable there as an open-minded breeder. My friends are a different story."
Five,"Im confused why others gave mixed reviews.  I've been coming to this location for years for my three dogs. I have the Banfield plan so a lot of routine care is covered what's great with the plan is I something comes up unexpected, they will squeeze you in same day, and the visit is free unless u need meds or something extra! They also make multiple courtesy calls to remind you that your pet is due for a check up which busy people that forget appreciate. Love te docs and nurses here too. They treat your poochies like family!!"
Two,"""Saw all the good reviews on yelp and decided to try it for my friend's birthday, and thinking it would be an 'experience' as many have described. \n\nBut it doesn't live up to expectation unfortunately, first off, the location is very remote and next to a car rental and supply store ... not that impressed.  As for the decor, it's decent ... nothing to rave about\nService was very good ... but the food was just a OK.  Ordered the 5 course tasting menu , plus there are a lot of bite-size bonus dishes, some of them are pretty good ... but some are just so so ...  \n\nI did expect it will be big plate with few piece of this and that with a lot of decoration ... but given that, I did expect each dish would be like \wow\"""" ....  but unfortunately none of them are .... they are not bad but certainly not out of the world ... I certainly have much better for that price range."""""""
Three,"""OK so I end up here for lunch only because the place I wanted to go didn't open till 4pm.\n\nIt's really beautiful inside, there is alot of elements working, chain, leather, iron, wicker, wood, very upscale modern but comfortable too.\n\nFirst off I notice that the menu is a bit different than the one shown \non-line, specifically the description for the tortilla soup. Needless to say, I did not get it.\n\nWe asked a few question and come to find out that none of the entrees are served with rice and beans? WTF!! \nSo you would have to spend $4 for a side of beans and $4 for a side of rice on top of your entree price which is anywhere from $14 and up.\n\nI'm all about having a good meal at any cost but that seems absurd.\n\nChips and 3 salsas were served, they were all pretty good, nothing spectacular.(see pics)\n\nI ordered the tostada with no meat and the Mr. ordered the fish tacos (see pics)\n\nMy tostada was really good, I dare say a 5 star tostada. I liked it alot. However  the menu said \chicken tostada $9\""""  and I was still charged $9 for NO MEAT..........that was pretty uncool.\n\nThe fish tacos looked pretty, he kept saying they were good, but his face did not tell me the same story and he does not know fish tacos like I do, I tasted the fish.....blech........soooo soooo fishy MY God! and no flavor either, just dredged in flour and flash fried.\n\n3 solid stars, not bad ,not extraordinary, not worth rushing back to\n\nTo me the Tempe Market place along with this restaurant are very, very touristy. I've got better places to be Thank You Very Much!"""""""
Five,"Yum. Yum.  Yum.     The burritos here are awesome, as are the sope's, the service is super-friendly and it makes for a great quick lunch or dinner.      My girlfriend absolutely loves this place and I've become a fan as well.     Good food, good prices, good service, I'm there, and I'll be back, again and again.    Their flan is terrific and the selection of tortas and burro's is outstanding as well.     Give this place a shot, you won't regret it, beats the pants off the gringo fast-food establishments like Taco Bell."
Four,"I admittedly went to this place due to the Yelp reviews.  I was very pleased that they led me the right way.  This is a one-of-a-kind endeavor, where the restaurant seems to ignore all traditional principles in marketing.  Meaning, its somewhat hard to find - you could easily walk past this place and not even know it was a restaurant or that 30+ people are inside dinning and drinking away.\n\nI also love the menu - hot dogs, grilled cheese sandwich, ballpark pretzel - along with some more modern fare.  Given the style inside the place, you would have assumed you would be eating some eccentric dish.  Not this place!  Just keeping things fairly low key and loose.  And that comes across as truly original in my book - something I've found a lot of Phoenix establishments lacking.  \n\nI can repeat the reviews with the darkly lit rooms.  Obviously, they've read these comments and have no interest in upping the lighting.  Which is fine considering you're not ordering any braised pork or white-collar dish.  However, it does get a bit tiresome grasping for a candle so you can make out what the menu says.  I guess to each their own...\n\nAll in all, as a visitor to Phoenix several times, I came away a sense that this is one of those big city finds that I also thought was missing in Phoenix.  Dine/drink someplace that isn't in a mall setting.  I would highly recommend this place for someone seeking an out-of-the-box experience in a quaint, casual setting.  Cheers"
Five,"I was extremely happy with my meal here.  The salsa with the chips was nicely spicy.  I had the shrimp and octopus a la Diavolo.  The Diavolo sauce was delicious and also spicy in a different way than the salsa for the chips.  I was given a large flour tortilla and couldn't resist dipping and redipping.  The sides of salad (standard shredded lettuce, etc., but very fresh and crunchy), rice and refried beans were substantial.  After the chips, main course, salad rice and tortilla I couldn't do more than scratch the surface of the refried beans.  \n\nI was equally happy with the atmosphere and service.  I showed up near 1pm on Sunday as a single diner.  Most of the other people were family groups, many apparently regulars.  I was nonetheless given a decent table normally seating four after the promised 10-15 minute wait and no sense of being rushed or treated differently by any of the staff.  Next time I'm in Phoenix I will be eager to come back (bringing family and/or friends) and have the same thing again and/or explore the rest of the menu."
Four,"This place a new local favorite of ours, tried on a whim one night and have been back 3 times and so far my favorite is the chicken katsu and the tempura shrimp udon noodles, boba's are great and reasonably priced. The staff is nice, it appears to be family run, but the only thing is, try not to ever use the bathroom... it is in the very back beyond boxes and boxes of stuff and has a foul smell to it!  Overall great Korean bbq at an affordable price!"
Five,"""...as Johnny Depp leans forward, placing a morsel of dark chocolate to my lips...\n\n...oh...er...sorry, was I daydreaming?  *blush*  Ha ha...silly me.\n\nAlthough your senses do get a bit of a shock when you first walk in to Chocolate Surprise.  It's a small shop near Brookside Bar & Grill that's easy to miss but definitely hard to forget.\n\nMore like an art museum than a chocolatier, you immediately are greeted by a showcase of their chocolate offerings displayed so beautifully that I wanted to try every one of them.  At $1.50 per truffle, it's not a cheap food, but treating oneself once in awhile is a must.  Look at it this way - the prices make you want to pick up a few, but not go on a chocolate binge to ruin the 2 hour workout.\n\nTheir menu is like ordering sushi.  All of their truffles are listed with a brief explanation.  Everything is handmade at the location and handpainted by the two Masters of Chocolate...even down to a miniature \abstract\"""" painting, in the words of Stan, one of the owners.\n\nSo now we get down to the nitty gritty...how does it taste?\n\nThe Green Tea Truffle was by far my favorite.  If you like dark chocolate and the light fragrant scent of green tea, you'll love this one.  Yum!\n\nMy second favorite was the Thai Tea Truffle mainly because at first you didn't notice the tea flavor, and suddenly on an inhale, the flavor completely permeated around my mouth.\n\nThird was the Hazelnut Toffee Truffle.  Hazelnut and Toffee...match made in chocolate heaven.\n\nFourth was the Passionfruit Truffle.  You could definitely taste the passionfruit, although it too kind of snuck up.\n\nFifth - the Arboli Truffle.  While it was an ok taste, I would have liked the chili flavor to have been slightly more pronounced.\n\nIn tie for sixth place was the Rose Truffle and Caramel Sushi.  The Rose Truffle was supposed to be infused with rose nectar, but it was so light the chocolate overpowered anything else.  The caramel sushi while still tasty was only a miniature rice crispy with thick (albeit good) caramel on top.  Both didn't really excite me much.\n\nThey have many other flavors and I look forward to returning to try some others.  The owners were wonderful to talk to and really seemed knowledgeable.  Definitely not art snobs, although they are extremely proud of their work, and have every right to be.\n\nThis shop is a luxury for sure, but something that my eyes, nose, and definitely my tongue will long for.\n\nJohnny Depp or not.\n\n~le sigh~"""""""
One,"There was hair in the food. Not just 1 but 2 in the same Bhel Puri dish.\n\nThe whole experience was pretty bad. There is no indication of how you order your food and when you finally figure it out the food does not taste good. We checked sodas on the order sheet and when no sodas showed up we asked if we were supposed to go and find our own sodas from the front of the store and were told that that was the case.\n\nAlso the guy at the counter is down right dismissive.\n\nPani Puri was OK\nPapdi Chaat - boring, no flavor\nBhel Puri - boring and no flavor before we found the hairs\n\nNot worth the trip."
Four,"""The place is cute.  I came here to enjoy a stiff drink after dealing with all the nut jobs at True Foods Kitchen.  The place is dark and sexy and a great place if you want to continue a date and get all sorts of romantical.  The bartender makes a pretty good gimlet and an amazing dirty martini.  Where's the Stoli though?  A little sad about that.\n\nI know this is a weird thing to comment on, but I love their water.  It's a huge turnoff for me when restaurants serve water that tastes like metal, but this place had water that tasted like SmartWater.  I really enjoyed that.\n\nThis isn't a five star joint because of the redic reserved tables on a Wednesday night.  And it was reserved for a gaggle of \Woo!\"""" girls who would not stop taking blinding pictures!"""""""
Five,"Absolutely my favorite place to eat in Tempe. Cheap prices for great food. Before becoming a vegetarian, my favorite thing to get here was the chicken shwarma plate - and although I have a huge appetite, I still was able to take plenty home for the next day. Now, a falafel plate or pita is the way to satisfy my hunger! Make sure to try their hummous and tabouli! Their baklava is unbelievably good - the almond and pecan varieties are my favorites. \n\nBe sure to check out the grocery section as well - super cheap bulk spices, rice, and legumes (lentils, etc); as well as lots of items necessary for middle eastern and indian cooking. \n\nIn all of my years of eating here, I've only once had to wait longer than ten minutes for my food. Usually, it takes less than five, sometimes less than three minutes of time between when I place my order and when it's making its way into my stomach.The employees and servers here are some of the nicest people I've ever met. It only takes a few visits for them to remember you and your favorite thing to eat. I can't recommend Haji Baba's enough."
Five,"I still remember the first time I went to Joe's Farm Grill.  It was a mild May evening and we decided to eat outside. The idea of farm fresh foods really appealed to me.  I am always beyond satisfied with my meal.  I don't think there has been a time that I have been there that I didn't order a barbecue chicken pizza.  I am not a fan of most novelty pizzas, but this one is just amazing.  I'm pretty sure the bbq sauce they use, is the same one they use at Joe's Real BBQ.  The enormous tree behind the Farm Grill is sick and we always crack jokes about the sign about falling and scorpions.  The line can be a little long, but they are quick at the order window and it is definitely worth the wait.  Don't forget to try them for breakfast as well, mmm breakfast tacos...  Do yourself a favor and walk off that delicious meal through the farm and sneak a grape (when they are in season) that grow on the arbors and fences.  Enjoy and remember to eat local"
Four,"I could not help but the Chinese/Mexican food posting on the sign in front and had to try it out.  The menu has a great variety of Chinese and Mexican inspired menu items.  I had the Jamaican Jerk chicken which was hot and spicy and actually tasted the way that it does in Jamaica!\n\nThe fried rice has options - brown, chicken or pork.\n\nThe staff is friendly and will even give you samples before ordering.\n\nIn addition, each meal comes with a cookie.\n\nThe place is a dive, but you cannot go wrong with it."

Five,"Love love love Mabel's! It has by far the best atmosphere of any bar/lounge in Old Town Scottsdale and the drinks are awesome. I haven't eaten there yet, but what I saw of the food looked good too. \n\nI always get a Pimm's Cup and my boyfriend is a big fan of the Vioux Carre. The bartenders are really good and can make almost any drink. \n\nThe best part is that their happy hour goes until 9 and with food starting at $3 and drinks at $5."
Three,"I have been to Green on several occasions and I have never been as impressed as my friends. The jerk tofu and spicy peanut salad are good, but I feel they are overpriced for a few pieces of tofu/meat substitute and plain greens. The green burger was okay but I was surprised by how thin the patty was.\n\nI am in love with their french fries, however! They are incredibly tasty, whether plain as a side or as an appetizer as the vegan chili fries (by far the best item of their menu!).\n\nThe tsoynamis are delicious no matter what flavor you get and that is definitely a selling point!"
Three,"Very nice happy hour prices and good drinks. Don't go hungry though, menu selection is not big at all. I had a lobster spread and crackers. Needless to say, I'm still hungry. I did have two martinis though. They also have a live band too, but we left before they started performing. I did get my YELP free appetizer, but I had to speak to the manager. I asked the server and she never got back to me. Overall, if I didn't live so far from it, I'd go back for the hour."
One,"Waste NOT Want NOT!\n\nHad the Tom Yum Soup:  was extremely fishy tasting.  They explained that there must have been too much fish sauce and they took it back without our small dishes that had portions of our soup with the majority of the chicken.  We were surprised that when it was returned; it was the original soup we gave them (with less chicken cause minus what we took out when we first tried it) to which they must have put more seasoning in to curb the fishiness.  \n\nWe wouldn't have had a problem with keeping the original soup had they put our bowls of soup back in but now we had less meat and mostly broth left since it was thrown away before the 'fixed' soup arrived by another server.  Also, we wouldn't have minded them not wasting the dish (but since they threw away the majority of our original dish); they should've added some chicken back into the soup and not been so 'cheap'.\n\nServer asked if we wanted to order anything else and we politely said no since we didn't want to chance another poor food experience.  Server was sweet was the only consolation since we left hungry with less money since they also charge extra for rice.  Back to Malee's Thai Bistro we go!"

WTF is with selling tickets to lounge at your pool when you already have a full hotel of paying guests?  Thanks for screwing me out of a lounge chair, good service, some measure of exclusivity by letting every d-bag with $20 squeeze in your tiny pool. \n\nFrankly, I think 3 stars is being pretty generous for this experience."
Five,"Very good, reasonably priced, consistent Mediterranean joint.  We've eaten here dozens of times now, mostly at the Shea location but also Fashion Square and Desert Ridge.  Very good baba, hummus, felafel, pizza, veggie burgers, Mediterranean platter, and lentil salad.  Haven't had a thing I would not order again.  Service is good and consistent.  Another good thing about the Shea location is counter space overlooking the kitchen ... always reassuring when the restaurant is willing to expose its practices to diners, and sometimes interesting to see the cooks at work."
Four,"This place is so cute, I wish they had this in California. I would come here for breakfast lunch and dinner if I could. I thought the salmon plate was very good since there was plenty of salmon with a little bit of mixed greens and bread.

Their entire staff from the people running the event to the managers to the cashier were all very fast, friendly and helpful.\n\nI didn't really know what to make of this place.  Is it fast food?  Is it a nice, sit-down type of place?  I think it is a small, more \upscale\"""", \""""boutiquey\"""" Fudruckers.  I'm not saying that is a bad thing.  Just saying that is what I thought of the place.  \n\nAnyway, about the food:\n\n* Smashwedge Salad - my wife and I shared this and it was very good.  Very odd though (in a good way) for a fast food place.\n\n* Classic Smashburger - Excellent.  Perfectly juicy and tasty.  Definitely one of the best fast food burgers I've tasted.  You can see and taste that the ingredients were very fresh.\n\n* Smashfries and Sweet Potato Smashfries = No bueno!!!  I was really looking forward to eating these, but I didn't think they were very good at all.  I just do not enjoy rosemary on my fries.  French fries shouldn't taste like soap or something.  I don't know - maybe I'm just not fancy enough to like random herbs on my fries.  At the very least they could have went farther down fancy lane and provided some aioli which would have been nice.  Next time I'm going to hold the flowers and order regular fries for sure.\n\nI know I wasn't paying but I feel this place is overpriced.  An average of $6-$7 for a burger or chicken sandwich seems a bit high.  By the time you add fries and a drink you are over $10 which is way high for a fast food place.\n\nI really wanted to try the veggie frites but they were out so maybe next time I'll give them a whirl.  I may give the fried pickles a shot as well because I am very curious as I had never tried one before.\n\nAnyway, my first Smashburger experience was a pleasant one and I would like to return to get another burger, try their regular fries, get some veggie frites and maybe a fried pickle."""""""
Four,"""Hard to miss with a Centurion guarding the entrance.  \n\nI wished it was nice patio weather.  The place was very cozy and a little uncomfortable padded banko seating.  If the tables were only several inches higher, it would have been better!  \n\nFirst off, we ordered Baked Brie and Raspberry  wrapped in puff pastry hors d'oeuvres with a side of grapes.  A couple of glasses of light and fruity red Portugal wines paired well. \n\n\Can I have some lemonade?\"""", nope, no lemonade.  \""""How about Sprite?\"""", sorry, no Sprite.  So sad to see the look on cutie pie's face.  Even wine bars would have had something for him to drink.  \""""Okay, water is fine.\""""  He gloomly said.  We promised him an Italian soda next door at Lola's.  He cheered up.\n\nKiller pizzas, so I've heard.  We decided to order the Mozarella, basil (pesto instead), white truffle oil pizza.  The crust is amazingly toasty outside and soft and flaky inside.  Good 14\"""" inches for $12 pie!   We added Risotto with manchego cheese/chorizo.  It was very, very, very rich!  It was so rich, I wanted to reach for some bread to sop it up!\n\nWe were so full and carbo-ed up!  We didn't balance out our meals very well.   Good thing we took the lightrail downtown.  We needed to do a lot of walking after all that eating!\n\nKudos to the chef and the hostess/server, they were absolutely wonderful. \n\nDonec obviam redimus!"""""""
Five,"THE BEST MEXICAN FOOD IN TOWN! \n\nMi Pueblo has been my favorite Mexican food for years! Forget the chains and the greasy taco places. Mi Pueblo is authentic and fresh tasting. They don't use lard yet their food still tastes so traditional.\n\nIt is NOT fancy inside. You order at the counter and help yourself to their delicious hot chips and their zippy fresh salsa. The family that owns the place is so nice. They never mess up an order even complicated ones. \n\nThe food is incredible. My husbands favorites include the fish tacos, twin chimis, and the green chili pork. I love the chili relleno, the enchiladas, and the bean tostada. Try them for breakfast too! Huge plates of egg dishes, potatoes, beans and tortillas. Perfect hangover remedy! And I think they serve menudo too!\n\nEverything is reasonably priced. You spend half as much as if you would going to Valle Luna or Macayos and the food is 10x better. We have ordered their party trays before for football parties and for our wedding rehearsal dinner. For under 40 bucks you can get a gigantic tray full of mini tacos, chimis, and quesadillas. They are supposed to feed 8-10 but they are big enough to feed more than that!\nMmmmm..."
Five,"I don't park anywhere else! \nWell, unless picking up incoming guests or something... :) \n\nSeriously Parking Spot rocks! They are always friendly, quick to shuttle me to Terminal 4, quick to shuttle me back after I arrive, there's always discounts you can find.... covered parking, free water when I'm leaving.... love them!\n\nAnd... you can even join their Frequent Parker club to earn points for Free Parking! Duh...  if you're a frequent business traveler, why wouldn't you do that?? Duh....\n\nThey just flat-out earn my dollar (and my company's dollar) everytime I need to park at PHX. \n\nThanks Parking Spot!"
One,"""9/3/10. Our family decided to go for pie. We had to wait to be seated so they could put tables together even though the place was nearly empty. Then we waited to put our orders in. Several things we asked for were no longer available in fact not even offered off the menu anymore. Then when we got our drinks our server didn't even go around to each person to give them their drinks. She made us pass them around. Two in our party ordered hot tea and asked several times for refill of water which never came. We also asked for spoons which were again given to one person and we had to pass around the table. We rarely saw our waitress. When our pie was delivered it was auctioned off by someone else, and again we had to pass the pie around since they wouldn't give it to each person. He didn't even take the tray and stand away. It was left next to me blocking my way from getting out of the table. When hot water was finally delivered by yet another person only one container was brought for two people. When asked if that was enough and was told \no\"""" he took away the same container and again only brought one container back. the service was deplorable. When we went to leave I could barely get out due to tray and stand. It was finally moved a foot by another worker and still left for yet another person to remove it. If I were you please choose another place to eat. It's not worth the frustration and inept service."""""""
Five,"""It was my mom's first trip to Arizona and her first time horse back riding since she was about 12 years old. She's since had a fear but decided she would face her fear. I wanted to take her to the best place in Arizona. I had went riding some where else on my visit to AZ a year ago. I did some research and found that Spur Cross Stables had won \Best of Arizona\"""" several times. I read their web site and watched the videos. I must say, I was really looking forward to meeting the potbelly pig, Gilbert.\n\nAnyway, we drove out to Cave Creek from our rented condo in Scottsdale. What a beautiful drive. Cave Creek is gorgeous. Spur Cross is back down a bumpy dirt road and you do go up into the mountain a couple miles. \n\nThis ride was amazing. My mom and I were the only riders that day. Partially because it was a bit chilly and partially because we went on a week day. I rode a white horse named Smokey and my mom rode a brown horse named Echo. We were giving the option to borrow coats/gloves from them if we needed. We were also given a tote to carry on the ride (over the saddle horn) with our personal belongings and some carrots to feed our horse after the ride. \n\nOur guide was AWESOME. His name is Preston. You should request him. He took us on a tour that he said he doesn't often do with bigger groups and because he knew we could handle it. He took us way up into the mountain and just told us to let the horses do their job.. to lean forward when they were climbing up and to lean back as they were climbing down. He took us to some of the most breathtaking viewpoints. And he posed us and took several pics with our camera for us. \n\nAnd I got to see Gilbert the pig, as well as Norm. Apparently they were adopted by the owner several years ago after their mama rejected them. \n\nI was 100%+ pleased with Spur Cross Stables and would recommend it to anyone. I will be back!"""""""
Two,"""I love a good Fox restaurant. Let's be honest. They rarely let you down. I've been trying for months to get downtown to go to Arrogant Butcher, and was so excited when we finally had the time. \n\nThe decoration, as we've come to expect from Fox, was phenomenal. What a beautiful space. The pretzel fondue, while identical to the dish at Culinary Dropout, was just as delicious in it's reincarnation at Butcher. \n\nThe food was delicious, burgers cooked to perfection, the turkey sloppy joe is hearty and stays together, making it rather \unsloppy\"""", etc. \n\nThe reason for my 2 star rating lies with the service. We made requests that were minor (no mayo, no lettuce, etc.), and every single edit we made was ignored. Usually an easy fix, when we brought it to the waiter's attention we were met with lots of attitude and not a lot of assistance. It's unfortunate, because downtown desperately needs more interesting and tasty options, and this one left me with a bad taste in my mouth."""""""
Four,"I've never been there at night, just for lunch and happy hour. I've never seen the place busy so on service I am going to give it two thumbs up. The servers are helpful and kind. The bartenders will chat with you and comment on the game with you. \n\nThe happy hour drinks are a good price, 3 dollars for wells and 2.50 for beer. And the wells are strong, I've had to ask for more tonic because the bartender was a little too giving, which really isn't a bad thing. They have specials on drinks almost every night of the week, shots, mixed drinks whatever, which is awesome. \n\nThe food, haven't been disappointed yet. I've had the smoke turkey sandwich, the bread was a little tough, but it had fresh herb lettuce and brie cheese which was wonderful. Also the jerk chicken on flat bread is to die for, especially, if you are looking for something light. The salads are amazing and come with either steak or tuna, both are tasty. \n\nFor entertainment they have a couple of flat TVs at the bar area. On various afternoons they have live music, usually a fusion of hip-hop/R&B. They also have fantastic Djs that mix just about everything. \n\nOverall its a great relaxed place, for nightlife I heard its one of the best, so maybe one of these nights I'll stop being old and go out :)"
One,"""As you can tell from my profile, I'm not one to write a bad review - if you don't have something nice to say...But I can't stop myself from sharing my experience at Quiessence - especially when considering the price.\n\nOn our anniversary, I thought it would be great to take her to a high-end spot like Quiessence.  I looked at the reviews (first time social media has let me down), it looked legit, and I set it up without telling her.  I made a reservation, let them know it was our anniversary asking for a nice table and offering to pay a little more if there was something special they could do.  For our near $300, here's what \special\"""" means:\n\n- A table by the door. I seriously can't believe they cram a table there, everyone who walked in was basically on our lap.\n- After taking our drink order, it took 20 minutes before our waiter returned, and with just one of the drinks.\n- We ordered, received our appetizers in ok time, and then waited another 40 minutes until our meals began coming out (we ordered special courses - big mistake)\n- Each dish came out somewhere between warm to cold, for sure sitting around\n-  Even if warm, the quality was not anywhere near the caliber of what a similarly priced meal at any other high-end establishment around town would be.\n- Tip was included in the bill at over 18%\n\nSeriously, unreal, when expressing our disappointment, we received a \""""sorry.\""""  Even if it was an off night, there's just too much here to ignore.

Five,"I love the brushes and many of the eyeshadows. The makeup dries too hard and emphasizes facial lines but the other products very nice. I just wish they could do the makeover quickers so you dont have to sit there and get a sales pitch. I like to pop in, get some ideas for new eyeshadow combo's and get out to another store, I dont want to pitch a tent and camp out in there for an hour. I love the blonde guy who works at FS location, he is awesome with color choices. He is quick too but he is usually pretty busy and popular."
Five,"Came here during restaurant week and was a happy girl from start to finish. At first I was a little disappointed that there was no steak on the restaurant week menu, but that soon passed. Our server was on point for our entire visit, drinks were always full, and he had a sense of humor. \n\nFirst of all, that garlic bread they give you is super special, very original. Topped with leeks, garlic, herbs, marinated  in olive oil, it was  gone quick. I had the baked brie with a raspberry reduction w/ toast.....this was sooooo divine, it could have been a dessert. I could eat this everyday and love it each time. My entree was the citrus glazed salmon, it was cooked perfectly and the sauce complimented the fish. The husband had the pork chop w/ au gratin potatoes...that pork was slammin'!!! Wow, it was thick, juicy, and ooh so good. The potatoes were yummy as well. For dessert we had the creme brulee and the chocolate cake. The cake was my favorite, chocolate & raspberry goodness served with fresh whipped cream.\n\nWe paid $40 per person and this included the 3 courses, glass of wine, and any other non-alcoholic beverage ( soda, tea, coffee ). \n\nThis place is not cheap, but the food & service is worth it, we will be back."
Five,"I'd have to say that among the restuarants in the Tom Jetland suite (Fez, Ticoz, Switch), Ticoz is my favorite because of its dimly-lit lounge-like quality, which provides it a cozier feel than the other two.  Add to that, the hypnotic Mojito creations and Ticoz is one of those places I could spend an entire weekend late afternoon at, as long as someone else drives, of course.\n\nThe tamales are fantastic and are more similar to corn pudding than to traditional hand rolled tamales.  If you get them with veggies, you'll find that the veggies are a little oddly cut for the dish, so I recommend some other topping.  The beef is fantastic (especially in the tacos).\n\nAll in all, this is one of my current favorites."
Five,"""I owe 2 of my 5 stars to timing alone.  I've enjoyed reading my fellow Yelper reviews on this place, and understand the mixed bag.  Had our timing not been lucky, perhaps my 2nd-only 5-star rating would be down to a 3.5 or 4.  I hear you out there, with the concerns of service, sitting way too close to someone else, Noca always being out of at least one item (happened to us the other night, also), etc.  I get this.  However, I do my best to try not talking myself into hating something before I give it a shot.  I don't wrinkle my nose at a previously opened bottle of wine from 5 minutes ago and claim that it's \turned\"""" and demand a fresh bottle.  And despite my God-given right of sending a $35 plate back to the kitchen if it isn't prepared correctly; I think I've only done this once in my life.  And I felt like a douchebag when I did.\n\nWe arrived early (around 5:20ish), without reservation.  I asked if they had a table open, jokingly, because we were the only people there.  Of course they were ALL reservered, but they had seating on the patio.  Fine by us.  And that made the dinner great, despite being seated in the parking lot and wondering why, and who, would park their burgundy circa 1986 Chysler New Yorker right there on the curb and leave it.  \n\nThese minor things aside, we had the patio to ourselves, which meant not having to sit on top of other guests and/or listen to their inane conversations.  It was perfect.  And then the food came.\n\nWe started with the clam chowder and shared.  Awesome.  Rich, artery-clogging, heavy-cream and butter filled bowl of awesome.  With bacon.  Everything's better with bacon.  My gal ordered the pasta special of the day, and I dove in to the pork belly with risotto.  Easily, hands down, the most tender pork I've ever eaten anywhere.  I am not a risotto connoisseur, I mean, I know when something tastes awesome, but I haven't traveled around and experienced the risotto tours of the valley.  What I do know is that this was like eating a smooth, cheesy cloud with an egg atop.  Paired with the pork belly, I was stuffed but wanted more.  Immediately.\n\nWe cleaned our plates, were drinking our drinks and then came the purple bouffant wig of cotton candy.  What?  Seriously, it would have fed a table of 8.  Outside of that cotton candy experience, I think the one and only other time I've had cotton candy was at the state fair when I was in junior high or something.  It was a nice touch, but entirely over the top for a table of 2.  Just spin a little of it, put it in a ramekin and that would suffice.  But I still had to go with the homemade donuts for dessert, with the caramel, chocolate and blueberry dipping sauces.  3 small donuts, 3 small donut holes.  Perfect.  And 2,000 calories ingested.\n\nFood - excellent!\nPatio to ourselves - excellent!\n\nI almost don't ever want to go back because I wonder if they'll hit this pinnacle again.  But we sure hope so."""""""
Five,"I need to preface my review by saying that Nike owned stores are not for everyone. If you want a bargain, don't waste your time. This is not an outlet store. If you're into sneaker culture and shoes are a vice of yours, you will come away satisfied. It's nice to be able to get access to the limited edition Nike releases at a legit source. \n\nWhile the store isn't large, they manage to hit the areas most people want: basketball, running, golf, baseball, tennis, and crosstraining.\n\nAbout my only negative is that they don't have anything for soccer or football. Since Nike makes so many team uniforms for European soccer teams and will soon take over the NFL jerseys, it would be nice to see some of that product there in the future. \n\nAll in all, I love this place and plan on blowing plenty of my disposable income in the future there."
Four,"""We arrived at the Superstition Farm for our field trip.  Casey, the owner, motioned for my son to take a closer look at the free range animals taking their siesta around noon.  The goose, almost as big as my son, was staring him down.  I warned him that geese can be mean.  I shared a story  when I was once chased by an African goose while jogging.  He then focused on the ducklings and chicks instead, smart boy.\n\nOur group of mommies and kiddos were finally complete to take the farm hay ride tour.  Then, car loads of Red Hat Women started pouring into the little farm store.  We all looked at each other and wondered if they were part of our tour, too.  My cutie pie overheard our conversation and yelled out \the Red 'Hot' Women\""""!   I'm sure the old ladies must have been \""""hot\"""" at one time, but they sure were cute!  \n\nCasey talked about the multi-generational farm and how they still run it as a family.  We now know more about dairy cows than we know what to do with.  There is also a petting zoo.  The crazy ass donkey startled us with its braying.  I want one of those little angora sweater bunny.  I don't know what you call it, but it's soft and furry just like my angora sweater. \n\nFinally, it was fun to shop for farm honey butter, herbed ricotta cheese and  a couple of cups of home made ice cream!  Little cutie pie went nuts over the novelty items inside the farm store.  \n\nWe love this kinda stuff!"""""""
Two,"""I have no idea how this place got 4.5 stars. Their food is possibly some of the worst food I have ever had. Ever. And that's pretty bad, as I'm not super picky. I've been to two of their locations and both times I was completely unimpressed.\n\nFirst time I had a burger. I requested it rare, and of course it came out well done. Like damned rubber. Anyone knows that once you go rare, you don't dare...go...well done. Ok I was trying to be funny and I failed, but you get my point. And the food came in some crazy picnic-type containers. Shit you'd see if you bought it at the Fair or your neighbor's BBQ.\n\nSecond time was a salad. Trying to be healthy!!@#! The \greens\"""" were pretty much ALL iceberg lettuce. REALLY you guys? REALLY? Too expensive for such a lousy salad. If I wanted to munch on what was basically water I would've ordered a free water! The one I created myself at Old Country Buffet tasted far far better. \n\nThe only thing it has going for it is decent drink selections/prices and a nice bar-like atmosphere. But tons of other bars have that too AND good food to boot. Like Santisi Brothers. Yeah, count this place out.\n\nOh, their logo is kinda nice. Makes me think the buffalo just drank Red Bull though."""""""
One,"""The waitress sucks. She's super rude. Don't let her wait on u. On my friends 1st visit she ordered a Malibu and rum.

Then we got yelled at b/c we stood at the game table too long. I can't say enough to describe how bad the service is.  When I asked for the manager the guy said he was \""""sort of a manager\"""".  I told him of our problem with the waitress and I'm guessing he passed along the message b/c for the rest of the night she gave me the dirtiest looks from across the bar."""""""
One,"I really wanted to like this place - close to home, simple menu of burgers and fries, nice look. I even gave it a second chance, but no more. The first time we went the service was tepid at best. The food was okay. The second time I went, the counter guy had his back turned to the counter and kept talking on the phone even though we were waiting to order. He was surly and went outside and spit. Eeewww. Again, the food was okay but the counter guy left such a bad impression I was kind of grossed out eating it.\n\nIt's a shame because it looks like someone spent some bucks setting this place up. Too bad the owner seems to be MIA - I can't see this place staying around too much longer."
Four,"I was here for the Yelp event and from what I saw and sampled I liked.  The apps we ordered were good, except for the calamari which had way too much ginger.  There should have been a sauce to cut it with.   We only sampled a small part of the sushi but it was well done and I would like to try more.  The mixed drinks were great.\n\nThe space is light and airy, just like the best Japanese places I've dined at (Morimoto, Nobu....however, the cusisine, while good, is not at that level). The larger menu seems inviting and our service was fantastic.  Looking at the menu, prices aren't that far off from various Japanese places of that scope (not necessarily in the Phoenix area), and perhaps even cheaper.\n\nIts not like other Japanese places in the Valley. Its not your average sushi place.\n\nOh, and the complimentary valet was a nice and unexpected touch."
Four,"I liked this motel. The people were soooooo nice!  It had all the amenities we could need for a stay.  It happened there was no coffee pot, I went to ask if they had one, and they fell all over themselves apologizing that they were all out.  Our room actually smelled like cigarettes despite the No Smoking policy there, which is why I didn't rate it higher.  It was nice enough and convenient, and the staff was super nice.  I'm not sure I'm ever going back to Apache Junction again but I would stay there again."
Five,"Trying to figure out what to have for breakfast - not really wanting the the usual hotel fare of sausage, scrambled eggs and french toast that's been sitting on a warming table. Talking with S on the phone this morning and he's on Yelp looking for unique places for me to check out that's in close proximity to my hotel. He mentions the Farm at South Mountain - it sounds intriguing, so why not? It sounds so much better than what was being offered at the hotel.\n\nThe Farm at South Mountain is one of Phoenix's gems...\n\nWhen I first arrived, I wasn't quite sure what to make of the place.  I took a walk down the little road towards the back end of the property. Here you will find an open grassy area with shade trees and rows of picnic tables and space enough for kids to run and stretch out their legs. There's also an expansive organic garden with rows of vegetables and flowers which I understand supplies the cafes that are on site with all their fresh produce. A little further behind the garden, the Morning Glory Cafe serves breakfast, The Retreat - a place for massages, facials, Reiki and mid-wife counseling, and the Cottage - a place for local artists to display and showcase their artwork.\n\nAfter I had breakfast at the Morning Glory Cate (that's another review) I spent some time at the artists studio looking over the work of some very talented artists.\n\nThe lunch spot is the Farm Kitchen which is located towards the entrance of the complex. By the time I walked toward the entrance, the Farm Kitchen was bustling with the lunch crowd. I didn't get lunch, but from what I could tell, everything looked fresh and yummy. I stopped in to pick up some fruit, some bakery goods and a drink while waiting for the hotel shuttle to come pick me up. \n\nThe Farm at South Mountain is a great place to find respite from the hustle and bustle of the city - even for a short while."
One,"Buca Di Beppo is literally, italian restaurant hell. You know how all big box chain restaurants throw junk up on the walls in an attempt to make the space feel vintage? Buca Di Beppo throws junk, and knick knacks and statues and anything else 'italian' they could find in the chinese warehouse where they loaded up these goods. It's a terrible horrible mess and you end up sitting in a yardsale of italian paraphenalia while eating your very bland pasta.\n\n\nIt's embarassing how truly flavorless the food is here. Thin, flavorless alfredo sauce. Thick slabs of lasagna with less taste than what I can get out of the frozen section at Publix. I went with a large group and across the table, bland food.\n\nWhen they seat your party, they guide you through the kitchen area where the cooks play along and say a welcoming hello. Deep down you know they hate this. Why are we in the kitchen? Sure it's nice, but I'd rather have them concentrating on making the food, and making it good. Of course, the food at Buca Di Beppo seems to be far beyond any point of return to tasting good. It's just dead. Dead food. No life, no flavor, not emotion. I get more flavor from the $.99 Michelina's frozen lunch package.\n\nFar from claiming anything authentic Italian, Buca Di Beppo even pumps out bread with no taste. Eating at Buca is like eating food from an assisted living facility. No salt, no sugar, no butter, no fat, it's all gone along with anything resembling taste. Sure, Buca has huge portions, and the setup is nice for large parties and families - but they might as well just buy the family-size pasta packs from the frozen section and bake it at home, even that would be better, and they wouldn't have to the mandatory gratuity. Say what you will about other italian chains like Macaroni Grill, or Olive Garden - at least their food taste like something."
Four,"I'm happy to welcome another Paradise Bakery to the Scottsdale neighborhood. At first I wondered why they would open a P.B. so close to their other one at the mall, but in thinking about it a little more, I realize that these two locations must get two totally different groups of visitors. \n\nThis P.B. is airy, open, quick and of course has the delicious Paradise Bakery quality of food. I won't go into depth about the food here since this is a pretty prominent chain, but their sandwiches, salads, soup and breakfast are always delicious (especially their Walnut Chicken Salad Sandwich and Tomato soup!) I like that this location has plenty of parking, enough space to hang out and do some work and fast service. \n\nNow I will say that with this being in Old Town, there are many other restaurants I would visit before coming to this Paradise Bakery. However, if you need food on the go and you're passing by this bakery, you will be happy with your experience."
Four,"I'm here pretty regularly, since it is within walking distance of my house. Sometimes I feel like I'm paying a bit too much, but I've started frequenting the specials and Happy Hour menu, which has alleviated some of that. I've tried the sushi, the gyozo bowl, the salads, and some of the pasta dishes. Everything has been pretty good.\n\nThe gyozo bowl is awesome. It reminds me of the spicy Korean ramen my mom would make me with mondu (Korean dumplings). It's pretty spicy and flavorful. I love sitting at the bar and ordering--things come out faster and you can watch with excitement as the cooks prepare the food. I've noticed a lot of the flavors run together and taste similar, but I'm okay with that because they're good flavors.\n\nFrom the outside, it really does look like a shady asian spot, but the inside is quirky and classy. The walls are brick and the decorations are well-chosen. It's a good place for a date or to meet a friend for a casual happy hour."
Three,"Ever go to a movie that everyone has been talking about because it is suppose to be the best ever.  I came here yesterday with really high expectations but to tell you the truth I don't have a place that serves my favorite fried chicken....or waffles for that matter.  The food was good, but I just couldn't get out of my head that it wasn't all that.  The chicken was very crispy but I wish it had more seasoning on it or something.  The waffles were pretty good but I really wasn't in the mood for that at lunch anyway.  The atmosphere was really cool, very casual and very clean, the pictures on the wall were neat and the service was great.  I don't want to downplay this place but maybe I need to come back and order something else."
Three,"This was our first visit here - the location was convenient and we decided to check it out for an 8pm'ish dinner.  The waitstaff was very prompt and friendly.  He was always checking on us and had helpful suggestions on the dishes (hottest).  The ambiance was delightful - it felt very private and the candles and general New Mexican theme was spot on.\n\nChips and salsa - the salsa - especially the green was lovely.  The red salsa had far too many tomatoes but had some nice kick to it.  Main dishes: Carne Adovada and Green Chile Stew...the feedback was that the carne was BBQ-y infused with red chile and too dry.  Sadly, didn't live up to expectations.  The green chile stew was very mild and wasn't the kind of quality I had expected - almost like stew out of a can with some flour and green chile added.  I will say the portions are huge, but since I don't eat that much anyway, that wasn't an added bonus for me."
Four,"I visited this place on the way home from getting my taxes done and I was famished.  My wife and I sat at the long, blue table along the middle of the restaurant...We ordered the mixed fry shopping cart with both normal fries and the sweet potato kind...Great!  The spicy aioli mix was great and the fries were seasoned just right...The Delux burger was worth the hype I'd heard..Grain-fed, well-cooked and perfectly well done!  My wife's turkey burger was good too and I usually hate turkey burgers..\nThey have an amazing beer selection...I actually got a Four Peaks Hop Knot and I wasn't at Papago or Four Peaks...\nI was really pleasantly surprised and recommend this place highly...\nI can only imagine after a night of drinking how a burger would taste at one in the morning!"

Three,"I stopped in here to find a supplement that the Muscle Max store next to Gold's didn't have. My husband likes Hi Health because he says it's cheaper than GNC. \n\nI went in and found the employees to be very helpful and friendly (without being over-bearing). The store offers a buy one get the second half off for many things in the store, every day. Pretty cool. It wasn't valid on my supplement but was for the liquid vitamin I bought. \n\nWhen I cashed out, the girl gave me some good tips on my supplement that I didn't know before, so I really appreciated that."
Three,"""Took dad here after golf one day thinking it would be something a little divey and would be good in sweaty golf clothes. I think we were both surprised to see how trendy it was. The menu was great, and I really liked being able to design your own sliders... it gives you a chance to try a few different things. I had the beef with bacon, swiss, lettuce, and jalapeno aioli and it was very tasty. I agree with other reviews though, that it was overcooked. The buffalo, I had how they recommended and it was un-frikin-beleivable. There was some sort of sweet chutney on it that made the burger. I'd go back for that alone. Dad ordered the onion rings and I tried a few, they were delicious as well. Not greasy, not soggy, just right. The wait staff did seem like a bunch of rookies, our waiter even turned the baseball game on 20 minutes after we asked him to and then stated \oh yeah I just remembered, you want to watch the game, right?\"""" The food also took a while to get out to us, like 20-25 minutes long, for 3 sliders and onion rings I thought that was pretty crazy. The waitress dropped a cup of aioli next to me and scared the crap out of some people when she said OH NO! loud enough to be heard outside. We also noticed the big Delux sign across the street where they are opening up, so Stax better get it together or Delux will run them out of town. \n\n+1 for the great food +1 for a good mix of music -2 for lousy/slow service that started in the kitchen."""""""

Its got the best vibe, the best staff, and the best environment.  Other places I've tried were super crowded.  I walked away more stressed than when I walked in.

I took my truck in for a wash and I told the guy I did not have time for a hand wax (upsell) I was then pressured into buying it in advance so I could come back another day and get it waxed. No was not an answer to this guy, I had to actually walk away to leave this Pressured UPSELL.\n \nAgain, I purchased the premium wash.

Four,"Although I didn't need Retail Therapy, I started off with one at Modern Steak. A small but tasty martini served with a carafe on the side containing a separate compartment for suspended ice - (AWESOME). Belvedere, Grand Marnier, strawberry, basil & lemon juice.\n\nFor starters I ordered the Roasted Beet Salad which had a lovely presentation and included Fris\u00e9e, pistachios and goat cheese. It was really good, but didn't surpass my favorite from The Parlor.\n\nMy friends had Oysters and the Tuna Tartare which they both enjoyed.\n\nFor dinner, I opted for the Chilean Sea Bass which was good but for $35 didn't have the best texture and the sauce was a bit saltier than I would have preferred. Perhaps I should have ordered a Steak at a place called Modern Steak? Small oversight on my part...\n\nFriends had the Heart Brand Akaushi 8 oz Filet...($78!) and the Beef Short Rib, Horseradish Gnocchi & Red Wine Jus, much better priced at $28. I tried the Short Rib which was excellent and they enjoyed the Filet, however it 'wasn't comparable to his $200 Kobe beef experience in Japan' - but then again, I have some high maintenance friends.\n\nAs far as the interior goes, Hayes Studio did an incredible job. I actually enjoyed sitting on the mock patio inside the mall with the over-sized lampshades and artificial round plants while taking in all of the textures.

One,"Like other chains, Seasons 52 is impersonal and cookie cutter. Prepare for a long wait that isn't worth it... 50 mins waiting and that was with a reservation (first told they were 15 min behind on reservations, at 35 mins we were told they didn't know how much longer the wait would be even though guests arriving without a reservation were being told it was a 45 min wait). So first tip would be to just not bother with setting a reservation here.  \n\nThough a nice menu selection and good flavor, the low cal gimmick is the hype and draw. Overall there are local chefs that are doing amazing seasonal and organic dishes with a more personal and attentive approach. They are far more deserving of our business than Season 52."
Four,"I dined at Bourbon Steak recently and was really impressed. I have been to many of the valley's fine steakhouses and loved the casual atmosphere (unlike the stuffy Capital Grille). Everyone from the hostess to the manager seemed thrilled we could join them for dinner.  The amuse bouche fries were very pleasant and I couldn't stop myself from picking before the appetizers came out.  I enjoyed the Hamachi Sashimi which was nice and light and a little fun, but not exactly amazing.  My husband had the steak which was wonderful and I had the fried chicken.  This fried chicken was awesome, wonderful flavor,and a no-bone chicken breast atop mac and cheese with a wonderful onion jus that really balanced the dish and made it pop.  For dessert my husband almost licked the bowl of the butterscotch pudding while really enjoyed my super thick and creamy chocolate custard. Then as the check arrived a nice little bag of caramel popcorn was dropped off to take home. How nice! Everything was wonderful except for the waiting. This is the one downside to Bourbon Steak, and what kept it from being 5 stars. A coke would sometimes take 10 minutes and dessert took 15. Always presented with a smile and apology for the wait...but still a shame.  I would totally recommend, just understand it may take a little longer than expected."

I couldn't even tell you all the delicious things I ate now, but that's exactly the point.  I didn't order for myself - I sat at the bar and ordered the Chef's tasting menu.  Razz himself decided what he wanted us to have and stayed with us thoughout the entire meal.  He is quite the entertainer and a very interesting man, to boot.  He knows his food is good and he will certainly be happy to tell you!

One,"""Returned for a second visit with my wife and found the place was fairly crowded. It was a weekend, so I figured that was to be expected. We put our names on the list with the three people working the seating at the counter, then sat down within a few feet of them and began our wait. \n\nFifteen minutes later, they call our name, party of two. I go up there immediately to find them escorting two elderly people away, following the guy who had called our name. Those elderly people had just walked in and hadn't even put their names on the list yet. I asked the other two at the counter what the third gentleman was doing, taking those people to our table when they called out our name. \n\nSo the guy returns from seating them and tells us, \Oh they said they were you,\"""" as his excuse. I overheard the whole exchange and never once did they say they were us. What really happened was that they happened to be standing there, he assumed they were the party of two he was supposed to be seating and he said, \""""Right this way folks!\"""" and they followed him to (what should have been) our table. \n\nNevertheless, confronted with this, the coward continued to put the blame for his idiotic mistake squarely on the shoulders of the innocent elderly couple who didn't even know what had happened. This was some high school kid with the wanna-be goth / emo thing going on, jet black hair and some kind of ridiculous black earring 'thing' dangling out of his left ear. Yeah, really classy having this guy scapegoat a couple in their 80s because he wasn't man enough to admit he screwed up and simply took the first warm bodies he could find to the table.\n\nThe staff doing the seating did nothing for us. No call to the manager, no offer to compensate us for having to wait for another table after their mistake. \""""Oh, you can have the next one, just go back to waiting.\"""" No sincere apology, especially not from the emo coward, who scurried away as quick as he could, leaving the two girls to speak with the angry customers themselves. \n\nI informed them that I wasn't going to wait again and was taking my business somewhere else where they don't give away my table to what is obviously the wrong party. All three of them saw my wife and I, knew which party we were and they knew those people who just walked up to the counter were not us, they hadn't even put their name on the list yet. I can understand if one of them wasn't paying attention, but all three of them? If you cannot have three people properly taking customers from point A to point B, I'm sorry but you have an issue. \n\nI later called and chewed out the manager as well as telling him who was involved and how they cowardly pinned the fault on the elderly people. He assured me corrective action would be taken, but still defended emo-kid. \n\nThe last straw was when he told me that next time I should ask for a manager when I arrive, so he can make sure I'm treated properly on the next visit. I told him I shouldn't have to fetch a manager to make sure that a customer is treated properly, that should happen regardless. Apparently he hadn't figured that out before I told him. \n\nI won't be returning to this place if that's how you treat people and how clueless the management is. Giving away tables, blaming the elderly and no involvement from the manager? Talk about three strikes."""""""

Lunch/dinner specials often include soup, fried appetizer (like wonton, egg roll, crab rangoon, etc) and an entree or two. \n\nNot the BEST Chinese food I've ever had and certainly lacking in ambience... but worth it if you've got the cravings."""""""
Four,"I lived at CityScape from July 2009 through August 2010. I enjoyed my stay there. If I didn't purchase a home, I would have no problem still staying at Cityscape.\n\nCityscape might be a bit more expensive than some apartments, but you get some nice perks.\n\nThere is a diverse group of folks that live here, students, young families and professional and some empty nesters. For the most part, the complex was generally quiet, at least on my end.\n\nThere are many things to like about CityScape. Cityscape is close to ASU, close to shopping and to many major freeways-60/10, 101.\n\nThe grounds are kept generally clean although I never enjoyed the 6:30 am lawn mover outside my window.\n\nThe inside of the apartments are nice with a decent size kitchen. I believe almost all units have washer and dryers included.\n\nThere is a nice clubhouse that has computers, tvs and dvd rentals. The staff also have several functions at the pool/clubhouse throughout the year. \n\nSome really nice things about the complex is the nice pool. hot tub and patio area with propane BBQ. There is an onsite gym with several cardio machines, weight machines and free weights.\n\nThere are several BBQ pits located throughout the complex.\n\nMaintenance was always friendly and quick to fix and issues, \n\nThere are a few items that weren't great. If you lived on the bottom floor like I did, you could often here your upstairs neighbors rather easily walking around or if they were super loud during an evening. You could also hear the washer later in the evening, \n\nThe front office went through some changes. During my tenure, there were 3 managers. We had some billing issues at the start of our. We received a move in bonus, but was not accounted for. This occurred two months in a row. One month we were only billed for water and garbage.  Part of it may have been new staff or just incompetence. Luckily, some of those folks were phased out. \n\nWith the recent rains there was also a nice lake that formed that would last for days. The water was several inches deep and would cover from the garage to the covered car port in my area facing Minton. This just doesn't look good, but was fun to drive through in my truck!\n\nI also wish there was more than 1 recycling bin on the grounds, especially when the bin is on the opposite side.\n.\nOverall, Cityscape was a fun time and I would have no qualms recommending this location to anyone looking for a 1-3 bedroom apt.\nin the Tempe area."

Didn't want a drink, because I had beer at home, so they took 10% off and the gyros & fries was $6.33.  And let me say just one word about the fries - WOW.

Two,"Just attended the 7th annual Old World Oktoberfest, but after seven years you would think that they might make this festival a bit more exciting. There are basically only two things to eat, the shredded pork meal and the bratwurst meal. Other that that, you have some pretzels and strudel. THe strudel at $4 was decent and the vanilla bourbon sauce served with the struedel was a crazy good touch. This was normal strudel I think, but it looked like a tamale enclosed in its greek style pastry dough. Not the top of the line. Only one place served beer and they did have 5 varieties at $5 a pop. Those were decent, but this place is really small and boring and you might only be able to kill 90 minutes or less here. The $5 cover charge to get in means whoever is running this thing is definetly making a profit. There just needs to be more activity and spirit here and after seven years it probably won't happen."

Two games for .25 where you get a free ball was the only thing working. Not too exciting. \n\nMost importantly, the ice cream was bland and overpriced. One small scoop for $2.50.

The window coverings, adobe booths, throw pillows, copper bar top, teal awnings, eclectic mix of soft rock, and even the prickly pear margiratas. The feel and atmosphere are almost the same. They even serve meals on big metal plates, often times with tortillas under them. Anyone who thinks this place is original needs to go see Richardson immediately.\n\nAll that aside, the food here is really good. I ordered the Carne Adovada which came a little drier than what I'm used to a Rich's place, which was a welcome change as they really let the pecan wood smoked pork speak for itself. The tortilla accompanying the dish was not tearable, but rather so dried out that it broke when I tried to tear it. This was the only dissappointment of the dish. Beans and rice were identical to Richardson's, smokey and delicious. The girlfriend ordered the Enchiladas, which to her surprise were the Red, White, and Blue Enchiladas from Richardsons. One chicken, one shrimp, and one cheese, wrapped in different colored tortillas smothered in green sauce. They were very much exactly what we were used to.\n\nAll in all, I'd say that Barbara, the owner, probably is using the same recipes and has obviously used the same formula here. She is doing a great job, and I will go back if I am ever in this part of town again. Even with the prices on the menu being about 20% less, it's not worth a 35 minute drive for me."
Five,"The bartender, Shelley,  ROCKS; she draws her clients in, treats them like old friends and truly makes this place shine!  I would recommend Don & Charlie's just for drinks at happy hour.  The bar regulars are a dashing group and it's a great place to go if you find yourself wanting a drink and happen to be on your own -- not weird at all to show up at the D&C's bar alone and Shelley will serve you dinner with all the white linen and formal touches you'd expect, right there at the bar.  \nThe food is top notch (primerib!) and the atmosphere is upscale in an understated way -- and the memorabilia collection is stellar.  Our server was fun and caught on that we wanted to treat our guests (my parents) special that night and she was spot on taking care of Mom and making their evening memorable."
Five,"I can dissertate on less than good allergy treatments, sinus surgeons and their styles, quack cures for peculiar diagnoses, and the misery of it all when it goes bad.  \n\nI worked very hard to find Dr. Schroeder's Office.  It's been an excellent experience.  Consistenly on the list of Phoenix' Best Physicians.  Publishes in Elsevier medical publications, spent a lot of time with me as we got established in my treatment regime.  When people have allergies, I tell them to head here.    Sometimes I meet people I already knew coming in for their allergy shots.  Since a requirement is waiting 20 minutes to check for bad reactions, I get in some nice conversations.  They also have pretty good magazines."
Four,"I was never a fan of Mexican food.  I craved Mexican food about 2 times a year.  It wasn't until I had a torta from this place that I now want to go here every week.  Tortas... yum.  I always get the Rancheras C Papas, avocado, chipotle mayo, grilled beef and cheese on a toasted bun.  Hubby got the Del Ray Torta, (view photo).  Add a Coke from the glass bottle, you know the kind of coke that is made with sugar cane and NOT corn syrup, let's just say it's pure heaven in my belly.  Agua Frescas are delicious as well.  Watermelon, Cantaloupe, Mango, taste like your drinking the fruit itself.  So refreshing and light.  Don't forget the shrimp ceviche especial, at .99 cents, you will want about 10 more of these... will take a picture next time I go. The only downsides, they serve potato chips instead of tortilla chips.  No alchohol, but trust, once you bite into one of these filling sandwiches, those two faults are easily forgivable if not forgotten."
Three,"It's the kind of dive bar that you feel safe in....slumming without the risk.  Last night went back again to check out a friends band.  The service got slower as the place got busier, I actually sat with no drink for at least 45 minutes.  Didn't try any food since we had eaten before, but what I saw go buy didn't inspire me to want to order - it all looked like sub-par, deep fried muck.  But I wasn't there for the food, I was there for the music.  \n\nIt's still a great venue for loud, fun music.  While you couldn't talk during the sets, the music sounded good, and the room shape and size created a nice fee, and the raised booths along the back wall allowed even those of us in the back to see the stage.\n\nI don't ever see myself adding this to any of my must dos except for the music scene.  They do have a decent selection of on tap beers, so for a show and a few drinks, it's a good night out."
Five,"So this one tops King's Buffet for us! A tiny bit pricier because the $8.99 doesn't include drinks like King's does but TOTALLY worth it! And yes, their teriyaki chicken is better than King's too!!\n\nWe (my husband, daughter, and I) met up with Rand H. and Mike C. for lunch today and it was a great choice! So much variety and everything was fresh and steaming. Service was awesome and the right amount of helpful, not in your face but there when you needed it. \n\nMy only complaint was the fried rice, they only had shrimp fried rice out today and I'm allergic to shrimp so I had to pass. My husband loved everything he tried except the sweet and sour chicken, it tasted a tad bit bland to him but I thought it was fine. Not spectacular like everything else but still great. My daughter ate everything we offered her (not typical lately!) and was delighted with the beautiful fresh plump grapes they had available. I believe she also stole my husband's chinese donut and loved it too. \n\nBy the way, this 5-star rating may just be the first one I've handed out to date so congrats to you Hong Kong Gourmet! And thank you for the awesome food!!!"
Three,"I just had to up this Starbucks one more star because the surly dude who works there isn't half as bad as I previously described him.  He is just who he is... a little curt, but also kind of funny in a Joe Pesci-kind-of-way. And, I am thrilled to say that I L-O-V-E their seasonal Carmel Apple Spice drink! It is delicious! \n\nBut, in all honesty, I still can't give any Starbucks more than three stars. Yes, I go there for an occasional mocha or seasonal drink, but they are soooo overpriced, and their coffee is just not that great. The hype of Starbucks bothers me, but I'm a sucker for branding, so I guess I'm a hypocrite. Oh well."
Three,"The dog park has been upgraded. Rejoice!\n\nBoth the main area and the separate small dog are have fully grassed terrain. There are tons of water bowls around, so that's good to see. Also a myriad of dogs and owners when before they were scarce.\n\nIt could use a little more shade and some strategic places to sit, but compared to how it was before I would say it is a damn doggie paradise. \n\nBig props to the City of Phoenix for making this a legit dog park. Steele Indian School is the city's largest park afterall, so it seems warranted."
Four,I heard there aren't many Vietnamese places in Phoenix area. This place is in a quiet shopping center with a lot of empty spaces. The restaurant itself has few tables but clean. \n\nCompared to my fav Vietnamese place in NJ I have to say this is not as good but it is plausible. The menu is quite overwhelming with a lot of choices. It maybe confusing to me but a Vietnamese family came at the end of my dinner tells me it is an authentic place after all. \n\nI think I will be back when I am in the area again.
Four,"""This place is pretty fantastic.  Mindfully I have not had much (Read: Any) other Ethiopian food, so I don't have anything to compare it to, but everything I got was very good.  I wasn't in the mood for anything to spicy, so I got the \Mild Combination\"""", which I was very happy with.\n\nMost vegetarian dishes I have had in the past usually have either lacks in texture, or lacks in flavor, but the fosolia I had lacks in neither. It was spiced perfectly, and although it was soft enough to eat similarly to a sauce with Injera, it still had quite a pleasantly solid texture to it.\n\nThe Alicha Sega Wat was nice tender meat in a well seasoned sauce.  The only problem one could fault it with was that it was kind of monochromatic if flavor, but that one flavor was delicious, and when eaten with the Injera takes on a layered flavor that made it quite fantastic.\n\nI also got some Kootee (Tea made with leaves from a coffee plant) which was another great new experience for me.  The only thing that wasn't good was the salad, which was made with not the freshest lettuce, but there was so much delicious food, that I was not hungry for it anyway."""""""
Five,"""I finally got to play the home course to my old stomping grounds, Arizona State University. I went to ASU fresh out of high school, but didn't last long because of a terrible GPA - at that time, I was not an obsessed golfer like I am now. So I never made it out to Karsten.\n\nI walked into the Pro Shop and was like a kid in a candy store. They had ASU shirts, gloves, shoes, hats, flags, bags, head covers - anything and everything. I got a couple of shirts and a cap, and met the other golfers in my group.\n\nThankfully the other players in my group had played here the day before - so they were able to give me all kinds of tips from their experience. \n\nThe course is in great shape. The front nine is not very scenic, the nearby factories, power lines and water towers provide the backdrop. However, the magnificent campus stadiums provide the scenery on the back. Being a former Sun Devil, seeing Sun Devil Stadium as we came down the 18th fairway brought back many memories...\n\nThe course is pretty tough. There is a ton of water in play, and it is by far the thickest rough I've ever seen. It made it very tough to find your ball and even the shortest of chips were difficult. Some rough was 6-8\ high.\n\nOverall, a great bargain ($70), a fantastic Pete Dye design, and awesome views of campus. 4.5 stars."""""""
Four,"Nice Sunday in the Park with the Hubby's family.  The park has a little duck pond of a lake that looks like people try to fish at. There are lots of paths all over great for rollerblades, scooters, bikes and walks. They also rent paddle boats , go cart like bikes and family bike carts. The park has lots of ramadas with grills and big picnic tables.  The bathrooms are at the ends of the park but its not a bad walk.   They also had a kids / baby playground at the north end of the park but we didn't venture over there."
Three,"""For those who are confused. this used to be the India Palace on 51st and Greenway and prior to that it was on 7th avenue and Bell. It seems the quality of the food changes with each new location. The quality of the food has changed..and not for the better unfortunately. I stil think India Palace is one of the better Indian restaurants in the valley and would recommend it for the casual Indian diner. But for an Indian person or a non-Indian who is used to eating Indian food and has more discriminatory tastes, I would ask you to go elsewhere. I recently dined here and it had the same problems it had last time. It's curries are too watery. It's naan are too small and \dish rag\"""" like and pala/saag was also very runny and had a baby food like consistency.  The nice thing about this place is of course it's ambience which is beautiful, contemporary and new. The service is also pretty good here."""""""
Four,"I found it, I really found it!  For the past two years, I've been looking for a solid thin crust pizza with green olives, doesn't sound like a huge feat, but it's been treacherous! I've found good pizza with no green olives, and green olives with terrible pizza, neither the combination I was looking for.  Little Chicago's finally did it, Crunchy crust, tangy sauce, real salty cheese, and green olives!  The prices are also pretty reasonable, you might pay 20 % more that Papa John's, but homemade sauce and crust is well worth it!"
Four,"Definitely my favorite place to go to in Tempe whenever I am there and especially when I lived there.  I was one of the lucky ones who started going there the week they opened and what seemed like every week there-after until I moved about two years ago.  When I have been back, I've been saddened to see how hard it is just to get a table outside.  The service has always been so-so, but the food, beer and music have always been excellent.  Kiltlifter and 8th Street are my favorite beers and for some reason I love the garlic cheese beer bread as simple as it is.  \n\nI've been to the one in Scottsdale and it is not nearly as cool as the original.  \n\nDo they still have the pumpkin decorating contest around Halloween?    Great times.  Hope to visit again soon."
Four,"Ok, so on Gabe's recommendation, I tried the Blackened Ahi Tacos today... they were freakin awesome! The ahi was seared perfectly and they come in a hard shell WRAPPED in a soft shell to keep all that good stuff in!! \n\nMy coworkers and I come here alot for lunch and after work drinking sessions... the bartenders know us well and take very good care of us... even when we get a bit rowdy! \n\nFor a chain restaurant Gordon Biersch knows how to bang out some damn good food! Word to the wise: Stay away from the garlic fries if you're only half way through your work day... they are POTENT!"
Five,"This is close to school and our preferred spot for a quick bite in between class. \n\nThe jalapeno cilantro hummus is delicious, as is the roasted red pepper hummus and the regular hummus. \n\nI have had both the falafel and spicy chicken wraps, and they both certainly delivered. Beware- They are HUGE! I took the other half home for dinner both times.\n\nThe staff is always friendly, always accommodating our large groups and splitting our checks for us without a moan and groan. \n\nBTW- they have options for vegans, vegetarians and carnivores. This place is good for all!"
Four,"I'm really surprised at some of the lackluster reviews. Sometimes when I read yelp reviews I get the feeling some reviewers feel chain restaurants can do no right! How unfair!\n\nI believe Benihana is one such place.\nIf you're coming for the show, great - I've seen it. You may enjoy it.\n\nI come for the food and service. \nI have been consistently impressed with both.\n\nSteak, chicken, shrimp, scallops, sashimi, sushi, sushi rolls, the onion soup, the vegetable tempura, and so on.\n\nI have infrequently had issues with the food. I told them it was unacceptable and it was whisked away to be replaced with more than acceptable food. No grumbling, fussing, evil looks, or exasperated sighs - just a quick fix of the issue.\n\nI have never had any issue with the wait staff. \n\nWe had an issue with one chef once. He simply couldn't get things right, he even dropped his knife. We didn't even say anything, but the manager showed up, brought us desert AND comped our entire meal. That speaks to the watchfulness of the management and their commitment to quality. \n\nMy spouse can be a very particular eater. Yet we have returned time and again here because they get it right.\n\nThe only thing that keeps it from 5 stars are the hours (they're closed between 2pm and 5pm right in the middle of MY lunch time), and they can be a bit pricey."
Five,"""Ah, Houston's.  I mean Houstone.  I mean HILLSTONE.  I never thought that a chain restaurant would become our \go-to\"""" place, but we've been to Hillstone about once a week for the past few years--we reluctantly followed it from the Esplanade location, but I have to say that the new space really won us over--and it's just so consistently excellent.  We always sit at the bar, and the bartenders are without question the most skilled, professional, and friendly in town.  The service is matched by the food--everything, and I mean everything, is done well here.  I won't even waste time recommending dishes because all of them are fantastic.  I will say that they do fish particularly well and their prime rib--both as an entr\u00e9e and piled high on their French dip--is out of this world.  Go to Hillstone, get a seat at the bar, but don't tell them that Patiocat sent you because that clearly isn't my name."""""""
Four,"Not bad.  We ordered the beef chow fun, mongolian beef, chicken lo mein, and the teriyaki chicken.  We also brought in a coupon for free cream cheese crap won tons.  I didn't care much for the mongolian beef, but there was nothing bad about it, really.  My husband loved his beef chow fun.  I think I will probably try all new items next time.  The teriyaki chicken was pretty good though and I loved the cream cheese crab won tons.  The price was right and service was good too."
Four,"""I'm just glad that they brought back the Strawberry \fields\"""" salad.  Yummo!  Fresh greens, goat cheese, fresh strawberries, bell peppers, onions, glazed pecans, chicken and this amazing viniagrette dressing! Wowwy Mowwy!  Oh, and it comes with a crusty buttery cheesy bread.  I have had a few run ins with bad waiter service, but the manager was always quick to come by our table to ask if anything else was needed.  As long as I get what I ordered and I dont have to poke around their tables to make \""""eye contact\"""" with my server I'm ok.  They know they will get a mideocre tip if their service is so-so.  It's on them.  My mother got a red velvet cupcake on the house for her birthday! That was nice."""""""
Four,"I invited a group here to thank them for being such great clients. We had a really lovely lunch. It was a beautiful day and we sat on the back patio. Good atmosphere, inside and out. We started with the tableside guacamole, which was excellent. It had a little bite, just enough. I had the mahi mahi tacos and one of my guests did too, we both loved them. Two of the other guys had the chicken arepas with white and sweet potato fries that I had to sample. Service was very good. I would definitely recommend it and I will be back for dinner soon."
Three,"MARCH 2011  Really enjoyed the spring training games but the stadium needs to mark the sections so fans can find their seats.  Way too many people marching up and down the stairs standing in the isle looking lost and blocking the view of the people trying to watch the game.  A simple solution would be to have the section showing on the back wall or even on the edge of the steps.  There were numerous people in the wrong seats because they thought they were in a different section which means even more people standing in the isle trying to figure things out.  By the third game this became a real annoyance.  We were in section 304 and that is next to section 306 not 305 so you can see how people are confused.  Hope they will rectify this, the stadium is fun and the Giants are looking HOT again!"
Five,"Amare Stoudemire used to eat here when he was playing for the Suns; you may disagree with his move to the Knicks, but you should trust his judgement in burgers. \n\nThe Delux signature burger is pretty awesome, but I'm going to be real: I like the grilled cheese or the hot dog much better than the burgers. Even better than either of these are the sweet potato fries with aeoli sauce!\n\nThe service is fantastic! The waiters are some of the nicest I've ever met. Try to get Brad if you can!\n\nDelux is open late, so it is the best place to go for food after a long night at the bars or clubs!"
Four,"I've eaten at a few different Red Lobsters in the valley and for the most part, I am rarely impressed.  The prices tend to be a bit high and the service tends to be only average for average food, in short a three star experience all around.   \n\nSo the Red Lobster in the Metro Center area was a very pleasant improvement over that experience.   We had a great server who kept up with our needs without being annoying and the food was pretty great.   I ordered the Salmon New Orleans with mashed potatoes and was very impressed.   My one complaint is that the Bloody Mary I ordered must have had an entire bottle of Tabasco sauce in it but other than that, the meal was delicious and the service was excellent.   Other bonuses include more spacious dining areas (we didn't feel cramped even though it was pretty full, as typical for a Red Lobster) and an excellent bar area that had a few TVs with the football game on.   Very nice ambiance in the restaraunt overall.  \n\nI will definitely be making the trek out east to eat at this Red Lobster again"
Five,"This place is great. Now I would like to qualify my 5 stars. These strip mall nail salons usually suck so bad that 1 star is too many. That being said, as a strip mall nail salon goes, this place is top-notch. But don't go expecting some amazing 5 star spa, you won't get it. What you will get is a clean, sanitized, friendly staff. The guy did my pedicure and it was one of the best I've ever had. My feet & calves were so sore from ballet and now - they feel great! I got gels done, and I will say they aren't really set up to do gel toes. (they are for hands). I wish they had the UV light a little more convenient for feet, I had to get up each time, but otherwise a very pleasant experience for a very stressed woman!"
Three,"""I've been to this store a couple of times now and I'm not sure I absolutely get it.  Normally, a weird store like this excites me but the lack of organization and uncomfortable layout bothers me.  \n\nThe lady who owns it is a pretty intriguing human being, with her purple beetle with very realistic bullet holes parked out front.  The store is hard to walk through and stuff is EVERYWHERE.  There is tons of strange items and I'm not sure what the use of them would actually be.  \n\nWhen I asked her where she acquired her items, she got quite defensive and said \I don't know why people ask me that\"""" and my friends and I thought, because it is a bunch of junk that you are trying to sell.  Strange.\n\nShe did mention that she does more stuff on-line than in store.  I'm not sure how she would ever get around to photographing all of her items and/or what site she uses.  A strange place, but I'm not sure you'd actually purchase anything.  I'll give it three stars just because it is strange and unique.  I could also see it possibly appealing to someone who has no need for organization while shopping."""""""
Five,"I am giving it 5 stars based on value and taste.  Presentation is not fantastic, and decor of the restaurant isn't great either.  However, you get tasty, no-frills Chinese food for little out of pocket expense.  I personally love the roasted duck, which is hanging in a heated box when you walk in (which is how all no-frills chinese joints should keep their duck).  It is by far the best roasted duck I have had in town.  Their Char-shiu pork (red chinese BBQ) is pretty darn good.  I can eat that stuff like candy it is so sweet.  \n\nOther favorites are the beef with green beans, sweet and sour (chicken, shrimp, pork....doesn't matter), and the chow mein.  I would recommend this to anyone that is on a budget and wants some relatively authentic Chinese food.  Sure, they have the Americanized stuff on the menu, but there are tons of fresh options that I haven't tried that are probably good.  I only say that because I have never had a bad meal there."
Four,"I'll start by saying the food is delicious. If I was judging on food alone, it would get five stars. So why only 3?\n\nI had a living social deal and a 20% off coupon. We couldn't use them together. Fine. However, we couldn't use either on the happy hour. Seriously?\n\nI wanted to try the tacos, but they were only on the happy hour or lunch menu. It was dinner time. So, to get tacos and not some ridiculously overpriced dinner entree, I had to do happy hour, which means I couldn't do the living social deal or coupon. Oh, and I had to eat on the patio. Happy hour is patio only. \n\nThe place was DEAD. And I had to eat out in the sun to try these darn tacos everyone raves about. I couldn't just enjoy the tacos inside? Really?\n\nTo top it off, the server was so apathetic. From not being able to use any deals to forcing me to eat outside all so I could try their tacos, he was the most ungracious and unapologetic server.\n\nI would just assume this was the Fuego attitude, but then I went to Fuego Cantina (a place currently not receiving the best reviews) and received:\n1.) phenomenal service\n2.) happy hour specials INDOORS\n3.) ability to use my living social deal on everything, including the specials.\n\nUPDATE (July 11, 2012):\nFuego done did some revising to their menu, happy hour, and service. You can now do happy hour indoors. Their menu includes tacos at dinner time. And the prices are monumentally cheaper. The first time I went the chipotle chicken pasta dish was $18. Now it is $11. \n\nAdditionally, the servers were much nicer. And they let me use my Living Social deal even though my drinks and appetizer were off the happy hour menu.\n\nNice job, Fuego!"
Four,"""For being in a landlocked state I thought this sushi place was great.  It's not on the same level as SF but all the fish was prepared well and had a good texture.  They have \reverse happy hour\"""" which starts at 10 and it is a fantastic deal, almost half off a lot of the nigiri which they also let you order without rice so it's like getting sashimi for $1 a piece which is a great deal.  I'm not a big roll guy, but we tried a few rolls and they were all pretty good, big beers were $4 during happy hour so a huge meal for two with drinks was only $70 total which is great considering a similar meal in SF would put you over $100 without a problem."""""""
Three,"Well I heard the food was good here so a couple friends and I decided to give it a shot. \n\nWe had sat down and got situated. We started off by ordering some fried pickles and they were a lot better than expected. Can't say the same for the worthless biscuits that they only gave us 2 of. \n\nWell then after waiting a bit we got our food. But after a wave of servers went around trying to figure out what goes to what table. Is this their first shot at the restaurant business, is there no order to what food goes where. \n\nUpon getting our food, seemed our expectations were just too high. It was good but nothing spectacular. The food must have sat under a heat lamp for some time, our gravy was dried, my meat was dried out. \n\nAll in all I would say go just a little further for a better place with better service at Famous Dave's. The service at Lucille's is just not on par. The servers are under trained and just can't handle the load."
Five,"I have been to Mabel's a few times now and I think it is a pretty stellar place. The food is awesome (try the chicken lollypops and the deviled eggs) and the drinks are strong. The ambiance is nice and cozy and I think it works well for a romantic dinner or a big group of friends. The staff has always been pleasant and accommodating and that goes a long way for me in Snottsdale. \n\nLast night I was wowed by Mabel's. We had a fundraiser for a great friend who has cancer and they not only let us throw it there FOR FREE, but generously offered to donate 20% of the bar tab to the cause. The service was great that night and they earned a fan for life. Thanks Mabel's, for being so cool, you're a breath of fresh air."
Four,"If you like it cheap and fast, Fiesta Burrito just might be for you!  I never eat at any of the 'berto's' places, but I'm not afraid of Fiesta Burrito at all.  In fact, the bean and cheese burrito I had there was a virtual fiesta in my mouth.  Ignore the fact that I'd had 6 vodka/soda's just a tad earlier that night and this will still be a viable review.  \n\nBut really, I've been to Fiesta Burrito on a few separate occasions-some sober, some not so much- and I've always enjoyed what I ordered.  Keep in mind I like to play it safe with cheese quesadillas, nachos without meat and of course, the much loved bean and cheese burrito, but the food has always been pretty tasty.\n\nPrices are pretty cheap too, and like another reviewer mentioned, the food is a bit greasy, but it sure is tasty!"
Five,"""Grimaldi's Pizzeria entered the world by way of Brooklyn.  Coal oven brick pizza, for those wanting a break from hearty deep dish, is a nice break.  Grimaldi's goes to great lengths to preserve their New York true ingredients:  claiming the secret to their true New York-style pizza is \in the water.\""""  They hired a chemist to analyze, recreate the mineral content, and composition of the local water in New York.  This composition is replicated and installed by a custom water system at each Grimaldi's nationwide.  Talk about keeping true to form!  (Facts acquired from Grimaldi's Story online)\n\nUpon entering to the right-hand side, there is a small bar area and patio seating.  Main dining area is front and center, with even a room in the far back for private parties. You are immediately greeted by the hostess and promptly seated. The feel is old New York, nice and dim lighting but not too dark. I particularly love the wine bottles suspended from the ceiling as lights.\n\nI ordered their thin coal oven pizza with Italian sausage, black olives, and mushrooms.  Thin crust and evenly loaded with toppings. It's easy to eat more than a normal serving due to the deceptive thin crust. Regardless, it is a delicious mistake to make. Pricing for each topping is additional ($2.00-$5.00 each additional topping).  It might work out better for future menus, if they created pizzas priced accordingly with toppings already added.\nAdvertisement\n\nDessert cannot be ignored.  Their home-style Oreo cheesecake ($5.00) is decadent and delicious for any Oreo fan.  If you are looking for other dessert fare, they also have cannolis ($4.50) and tiramisu ($5.00).\n\nSign up for their VIP Newsletter, to keep ahead of special events.  You will also receive a coupon in your email for a free large pizza on your birthday!\n\nThe staff here is friendly and accommodating, even the manager came over to say hello and check in on my experience.  If you cannot get to New York right away, Grimaldi's Pizzeria is certainly worth your time.  They take great pains to keep to their history and content, and one can taste this in every bite."""""""
Three,"To the reviewer who said this place is over-run with frat boys/sorority girls....I beg to differ.  \n\nI will agree that this place is always busy, and its difficult to find a table.\n\nOkay...now for the good stuff.  Beer.  I'm a fan of 8th st. Ale.  Lots of people seem to love the Kiltlifter...I'm not such a huge fan of it.  They also have seasonal blends that are pretty good....I can't think of the name of the one that comes out in the fall...but that one is good.\n\nFood.  I don't really care for the food here.  Its not that it's bad.  The food is pretty good for bar food...but nothing really stands out to me.  The only thing I absolutely always have to get, and love, is the spinach artichoke dip.  It's damn good.  I recommend it, heavily."
Four,"I went there today for lunch if not thinking about being saint patrick's day.  The place was fairly busy but Mollie made room for us for us to bar.  The patrons were friendly it was a nice atmosphere.  My friend had pulled pork sandwich which he always likes and I had the fish and chips.  At $14.00 the fish is a little expensive but was served with a nice size piece of fish and the good serving of fries.  The breading on the fish is a little thick but has a nice taste and I would happily have it again.  It was a good lunch, a fun time and worth the drive from Chandler-and the beer was great too."
One,"Wow! Colin you sure you were at SUCKER PUNCH SALLYS???? The one at Mill and University? Well I'll tell ya, I love a good diner and I was anticipating the opening of this place for a couple weeks and last night we went in for a late night dinner.

My girl ordered the Mac n Cheese.... Looked like it came out of the microwave and under the crusted dried out cheese on top was a bowl of watery cream! I had the meatloaf and fries with gravy... It looked like the meatloaf was cooked yesterday and fried on the grill to heat it up... The fries were crusted with salt and both the meat and the gravy were over salted... Didnt get the cornbread as advertised and my girl couldnt even eat hers. we sent hers back and I was able to get down 1 slice of the meatloaf and about 10 fries before I started to feel ill. The waiter walked by the table twice after we sent hers back and my plate hardly touched sitting in the middle of the table. When he did stop back and asked if I was done, Didnt ask if it was alright or if I wanted a box. Never saw a manager and NOBODY ever came back to check on us! I have NEVER just up and left without paying but folks..... F@#K this place!!!! Over priced, over cooked and BAD service... I dont want to hear it was late, or just opened! Your a 24 hour diner, the food should ALWAYS be hot and fresh!!!! No soups, no salads, no real selection!!! I left feeling seriously sick to my stomach. If someone would have stopped by and say sorry or what can I do, I might have decided on a second chance but you know after sitting almost TWENTY MINUTES after he took my plate with nothing INCLUDING the check!!!! Sorry... STAY AWAY!!!!"
Five,"""Our 2 daughters went to Montessori Educare ages 3 - 6 for a total of 6 years.  It is a real community with caring Staff, parents, and Teachers.  The class sizes are small and often times there are two teachers in the class.  We had our 2nd daughter attend Kindergarten there.  We were pleased with her education and wished we'd left the older one there too.\n\nThey expose the children to so much, they are sponges.  The teachers are well educated in the Montesorri style and the kids love working with each other.\n\nI highly recommend the school!  They have been named best pre-school in the Ahwatukee News \Best of Ahwatukee,\"""" several years in a row."""""""
Four,"My wife and I tried the new breakfast menu this morning.  We both really enjoyed it, especially the Mother Lode Burrito with milk gravy and the Raspberry Bread Pudding.  I have to say they really know how to make milk gravy; most restaurants and even home cooks have no clue as to what good milk gravy is, so I was impressed.\n\nOne thing they are going to struggle with a bit is that scrambled eggs will never be excellent when they're served cafeteria style.  The same goes for potatoes.  That's the primary reason our breakfast was very good, but not exceptional.  I understand this isn't something they can really change, but thought it was worth sharing the observation as eggs are key to most breakfast dishes.   \n\nOverall, the new breakfast is very tasty and well concieved.  We'll be back again in the near future I'm sure!\n\nBTW, the 25 cent coffee is a nice throwback.  If you want a refill you just drop a quarter in the pink piggy bank on the honor system--pretty cool."
Five,"Holy cow, I didn't realize I hadn't had the chicken here when I wrote my first review.\n\nThis place has become our unofficial work conference room.  Everyone is drawn to the magical chicken - moist and tender, with a crispy skin that bursts with flavor.  And ridiculously cheap - $10 for the whole bird, with fixin's.  The frijoles charros they serve before meals is worth the trip alone - I don't know what they do to them (it definitely involves bacon), but they are fantastic."
Five,"I went to the minute clinic at this location yesterday and i was very impressed. this was my first visit to a minute clinic and i have to admit it was probably almost better then going to my normal doctor. Given it was a weekday, so probably on weekends it would be way more packed. you go in and fill out your information on a computer and it tells you what # you are in line to be seen. i was seen in about 25 min, even this is pretty good considering even with an appt you make to see your reg doctor weeks/days in advance you still wait this amt of time or even longer.  My insurance was covered here as well, which was awesome so only had to pay my copay. the doctor was probably one of the nicest people i have ever met(seriously, so nice that it prob would have annoyed you if you weren't sick, since we all like to be babied when we are sick it didn't get to me) anyway, she really was great and got me out of their quickly and had my prescriptions sent over to the pharmacy by my house so i could leave and just go pick then up. i highly recommend going here if you need to be seen on short notice, can't believe it took me so long to discover the minute clinic."
Five,"I find Harmony House Music a great place to shop for almost all my music needs. The review before me I find to be a nervous shopper. The staff watches you to make sure they meet ALL your needs. I found the staff very friendly and helpful. I bought a New Fender Ultimate Chorus Amp, So for him to say what he did about their line is just not true. Yes they do allot of catering to students, it's called Bread and Butter, and I fully understand that. No they can't compete with the large chain stores with allot of the famous brands, But they do carry some. They  will go out of their way to make sure you are a satisfied customer. As for the antique side of the store, I have found many little trinkets of my likening. If you don't go look you wont know it's there. Over all I find Harmony House Music a great place to shop."
Five,"The meat shop in the back offers some good selections for you. It is very convenient to pick up from their refrigerated section or if you have a special order of halal goat, or cut up chicken etc then you just go in the back and talk to the butcher who quickly prepares it for you. A lot of people also choose to order over the phone and pick it up. \n\nWe were so disappointed over the last few months with Baiz market for their meat selections and offerings(their halal ground beef is just gross, even the extra lean ground beef is awful )  that we finally made the switch to I-Mart after 5 years of exclusively purchasing our meat from Baiz originally. The meat and prices are incomparable to Baiz as I-Mart certainly offers a better selection in meat and their prices are slightly cheaper plus we don't have to deal with any attitude from the butchers like at Baiz. I am glad we finally found this place. They also carry a bunch of Indian and Pakistani spices, indian desserts, whole wheat flour from India etc."
Four,"When you're tired of having to dress up to get into the bars in old town, DJ's will welcome you with open arms.  Wear shorts.  Wear flip flops.  Wear whatever you want and it's not going to matter.  Plus they don't have a cover charge, which is always a good thing. \n\nAnd while there isn't much to DJ's, (it's small and all attempts at decorating the place were spared), it's a good place to do some serious drinking. The bartenders pour 'em healthy and if you're not careful, you'll end up wasted without even realizing it.\n\nI like coming here for a few drinks before going out, or if I feel like catching up with friends, DJ's is a cool place to do it, because you can have a few drinks and actually hear your conversations!"
Five,"I've been there twice now, once for a mani and once for a pedi. Both times they were pretty busy, but very accommodating as long as you didn't mind waiting a little bit. The staff there are very very friendly and the place has a nice atmosphere. The shop isn't too big, about 10 pedi stations and 10 mani stations, but they make great use of the space and you never feel crowded. I'm a dude so I can't say much about their abilities to do gels or powdered nails, but all my friends who have been with me say its good stuff.\n\nI frequently do this and I will for sure continue to come back to Paulenes. Its a good idea to make an appointment on the weekends as it does get really busy, but as I said before, they try to accommodate as best as they can."
Five,"Love the  concept of Fresh and Easy, everything the urban professional needs to feed him or herself. Big Cucumbers (English ones) for 89 cents, sunflower seeds for 89 cents, Ricotta cheese 1ibs for $2.69, Orchids in a pot for $14.99 not to mention the fresh basil still growing in a pot for $2.99?? Pre-made couscous for 1.89. The prices seem ubsurdly ridiculous but maybe that's because they hire hardly any staff. You must check out your own groceries while they bag them, just start checking stuff through and don't wait for someone to help, they come anyway. \nI love the European style, size and no nonsense items, although I hope they survive to meet the American taste and market. Until then I will enjoy eating fresh and easy. \nI love the fact I've never had to wait for some old critter signing a check or someone fiddling with coupons, it seems like the average American doesn't have the aptitude to be able to help themselves at check out thereby aisles remain relatively empty. \nI also love how they are using relatively small urban commercial spaces that until now were largely abandoned being too small for the average chain grocery store--Good on you Fresh & Easy, Keep it up and feed the people!"
Three,"This place is a real hidden gem! In fact if you are distracted you will miss it over and over. A really TINY place and usually gets very busy. \n\nWe were a group of 6 that because of the change in time with our reservation, some had to cancel. The unpleasant part (and the missing star) is that the owner will stare at us every time as if it was our fault. To enjoy better this place DON'T go with a group larger than 4. \n\nWe had the fried noodles and yes, the salsas are worth trying. The bread with garlic is something I wouldn't order for it's price, but my friend enjoyed it. I shared a chicken and waffle with one of my friends and gladly this portion was more than enough. I wouldn't fry that chicken. It is cooked in a good way and the meet is really tasty, the breeding comes like a crust and it becomes too much. \n\nThe other dish that was tried is the mac & cheese. I really can't understand who orders this in a restaurant. My friend was a bit disappointed as he was dreaming of crispy prosciutto (never heard about this) and for him it was too tender.  \n\nWe also tried the rum and ginger ale, YES! try it! If there is a next time, I'll make sure I don't have a reservation so we can eat and enjoy our dinner."
Three,"Pizza A Metro, a tiny restaurant in a tiny strip mall, is definitely better than your Olive Gardens, but how the heck it has a 4.5 star average rating on here I don't know. It's just not that exceptional. It started out bad when the water tasted like dish soap. The bread and caponata is the best thing they have going here. Our $10 caprese was cheap mozzarella on pale tomatoes...for that price, I expect burrata mozz on beefsteak tomatoes. The pasta primavera ($13)  was very good, in a nice light garlic white wine sauce. Chicken marsala ($15) was good, not great, as was the accompanying pasta alfredo. Everything's about $2-3 overpriced, given that this is just a slightly above average neighborhood place. I won't be rushing back, but I would be okay going here if someone else suggested it."
Four,I've reviewed the Kohl's store located down in South Phoenix/Ahwatukee and seeing that Kohl's is a chain there isn't much difference between each store that I've found. \n\nBut once again I have to admit that Kohl's usually has some pretty good sales going. And if you add in the discounts they send you in the mail (or email) if you are a credit card holder you can really get some great deals.\n\nI'm always amazed how much stuff you can walk out with for the money you spend. Check out the clearance racks and sale signs throughout the store. \n\nThe store was clean and well-stocked and checkout was a breeze. \n\nI tend to be a thrifty shopper and am usually pretty happy with the Kohl's shopping experience. Hopefully you'll be happy too.
Three,"...the clerks are helpful enough, I guess, but there is something about the overhead lights at Lowes' (all of them) that makes me dizzy and unwell feeling.  I'm not sure if it is the buzzing, the color, or the combination plus the slight woody smell of the store but I can literally only spend 30-40 minutes here before I simply must leave.  Nice selection, good prices, but as a soon-to-be-homeowner with improvements to make I get the idea I'll be looking elsewhere."
Four,"My review may be biased because after bringing my mom in 2 years ago, who spoke vietnamese to them, everyone there is very nice to me. I am Asian but no I don't know what they are saying and I don't know why they whisper across the room. But they always do a good job on my pedicures and manicures/ acrylics. For almost 2 years I was a regular here, but it gets expensive from constant maintenance.. I havn't been to get my nails done in almost a year! How sad, I should make an appointment soon. Nice mini-get away and well groomed nails are pretty."
Five,"This was my first time trying boba, and it was delicious!  Eba has an amazing selection of drinks (and ways to prepare them).  I decided on tea+soymilk, boba with coconut flavor.  Mmmm!  It was sweet and creamy and wonderful.\n\nThe cafe itself is bright and welcoming.  I joined several other Yelpers there for Office Hours and we lounged on comfy couches.  In addition to food they sell a selection of gifty items too.\n\nIs it sad to admit that I craved MORE later that day?  Yeah, that's right... if this place wasn't so far from my house, I might have gone back for seconds."
Four,I live in north Phoenix and believe me there needs to be a lot more quality dining out here. This is a gem. The atmosphere is tops. The food is consistent. The management actually cares. It's just a cool place all the way around! A lot of corporate establishments seem to yank popular things off the menu cause it's just not trendy anymore. Every single thing I have had at this place was delicious! Not one other restaurant has pulled that off. A place you can actually count on for a good evening. High five to the Yard house!
Three,"where were you all when Park Central was desperate for customers?  They died as a mall in the late 80's early 90's.  The anchor stores were Diamonds/Dillards, Goldwaters/Robinson's and JC Penny's.  In the 70's there was even an El Rancho Market in there.  Great jewelry and book stores, shoe stores, restaurants etc.  But people didn't want to shop there - no - Metro Center was the place to go and now fickle shoppers are killing Metro they way they killed Park Central and Christown (the first air conditioned mall in the country)."
Four,I really like this spot for pie.   Not a big space and the atmosphere is just ok.   The pies are not cheap and not huge but they are made with quality ingredients.   Personal favorite is the solo misto with the smokey ham and egg.  We LOVE egg on are pizza and add it to the other ones too.  Last night we tried the Greek pie.  I wasn't a fan but my son and husband really liked it.   I'm not a huge fan of white pies.   They have a better then decent wine list for a small joint.   \n\nThis place is sort of hidden in a strip mall.  It is worth seeking it out.
Two,"And now, the long awaited Kabuki update... to be fair, this update is a combination of several mishaps and events... they all are related to each other, and therefore I felt they needed to be reviewed together. \n\nAs I've previously stated, I was never going to rush back to kabuki. The first and only trip was enough for me. However, about two months or so ago, I was invited to a lunch for a project I was on, and I hesitantly went. The lunch was back to back with a meeting I had... knowing this, and my issues last time, I arrived a half hour early with another coworker to make sure my order was in. We each ordered three rolls if I remember correctly. After we ordered, the others arrived (please note, it took a half hour to be able to put our order in... even though no one was in the restaurant).\n\nEveryone else began to put theirs in as well and sushi and other ordered items began to arrive. 20 more minutes passed and I soon realized everyone had their food but me. Even those that ordered after. It was now close to my time to leave so I flagged down our server and asked him if I could have my sushi to go. I wasn't extremely hungry, but knew I would be craving something by mid afternoon.\n\nIt all went downhill from here. Rather than checking on my order or anything else for that matter, I was attacked and accused of not putting an order down. After all, had it been, it obviously would've been at the table. After 5 minutes of several people ensuring him my order was on a list, I gave up and said to just bring me a philly roll quick so I can not starve myself. One of my coworkers graciously gave up his take home items so I could eat. I was ever thankful.\n\nI left angry and upset...but thanks to friends not completely starving. The food was good, but quickly overlooked by the terrible service I've received both times I've been here. Honestly the food is the only thing that gives them the 2nd star. I bitched on twitter about my disdain and soon had a message from their corporate office. They wanted to call me to discuss the matter with that locale. I told them I didn't really wish to speak with the locale. What's done is done. I wasn't sure what they could honestly say to make me feel better about how I was treated.\n\nKabuki responded with a rather generous gift card. I decided I would give them one more shot (after all, it was on the house). Honestly I was scared to use it... even with the meal being free, I wasn't sure I could handle the stress of another bad experience. It took me nearly a month to use it.\n\nThis past week, I returned and took with me the kind coworker who offered me their take home sushi. We made sure to go on a day where we didn't have any appointments immediately after lunch. We also arrived early. Once again, the place was practically empty. There were only 4 other people there. \n\nWe started off with drinks as we pondered the menu. The drinks my friends, are heavenly. I had a lychee mojito and an apple saketini and practically downed them in one gulp. Filled to the brim, tasteful and beautiful works of art they were. \n\nWe both ordered a few different items. I got two rolls and some nigiri. I was honestly shocked at the relatively ok speed at which they came out. We received our sushi about a half hour after ordering it. Still not super fast, but well, it's better than not getting it at all. The presentation was decent and the sushi was delicious. My ebi nigiri came with a tempura shrimp in the shape of a bunny. That creeped me out a lot. Please don't do that.\n\nIn the end, the service is still slow enough and I've had so many bad experiences there, that I would not trust it for lunch. It will never be in my top 5 places to go at any point in time. However, if I end up arriving at Tempe Marketplace 3 hours early for an event, or if someone wants to go to grab a saketini, I will consider it. The only saving grace this establishment has is it's corporate office, a saketini, and decent sushi (once you get it).\n\nThere are rumors that my picture may be in the back of the restaurant as a warning for when I come in.... hopefully this is not the reason I had a slight improvement in service."
Three,"""I love the organization of the store.  It has very well-defined areas, which made my first trip in a breeze.\n\nThe store is large and seems to have just about everything one would need, sports wise.  \n\nWe went in looking for sleeping bags for my 6'6\ friend and didn't see any that would work under $100.  Most of their bags are pricey, with kids bags being in the $50 range and adult bags starting at $60 on sale and going up to just under $200 on sale.\n\nWe did not check out prices on anything else, but this place is a lot pricier than Dick's for similar bags.\n\nI will check out this place again because of their selection, but I will definitely look for a coupon first.  \n\nA side note: We decided to try our luck at Target and found a bag for adults up to 6'4\"""" for $42.  Since my friend is not in need of a mummy bag, this will work just fine."""""""
Three,"I want to like Bar Smith, and I actually very much do. But...the 3 stars were inevitable after my lunch here a few weeks ago.\n\nFirst off, let me say that I really do like everything about this place - the ambiance, the vibe, the menu, the service, the prices...it's all great. Seriously. But I just can't justify giving a fourth star because my food was not very well-prepared. \n\nI ordered the Blackened Mahi Mahi, which came with a Pineapple Relish, Mixed Greens and a Cajun Remoulade Dressing -- very excellent concept for a dish, and the flavors were really lovely together...this dish made me believe that a pineapple relish may be the only way to eat mahi mahi. However, as I'm sitting there enjoyed the dish, I start getting closer to middle of the mahi filet, and I realize that it's not cooked...\n\nNot even remotely. Yeah, the edges were cooked, but most of it was cold and raw. NOT how I like my mahi mahi. I very kindly asked the waitress if they could cook it more, and she very kindly had the kitchen do so. They got it right the second time around (although it wasn't quite the same...), but it makes me wonder if whoever's back in the kitchen knows what they're doing...\n\nI want to go back. I want to try it again, because I have the feeling it was a fluke. I HOPE it was a fluke. But as for now, I have no other choice but to give them 3 stars...despite how much I really do like this place."
Four,"""The neo-Coliseum!... where the padded gladiators come to fight other padded gladiators unto the death!  The splendor!  The greatness of our new Rome in PHX!\n\nMy analogy may be a stretch (I am, admittedly, a former FS who loved to hit), but a stadium really does set the stage for a fight, whether it is circa 127AD or 2013AD!  The Cardinals Stadium (now sponsored by a notorious degree-manufacturing institution) creates a great setting for a special game or event.  The stadium is easy to navigate in-person, and the fung shui is generally on par.  That is, it has a relatively \new\"""" feel, plenty of amenities, and great views throughout most of the stadium.\n\nReady for my complaints?  If not, I am:  the online seating charts and visuals suck.  The upper deck is much higher than the lower/ mid-level seats, and anywhere below the upper deck probably even offers a better view from a slanted angel.  Not knowing this, I incidentally purchased two different sets of tickets (one set for a slanted lower-deck view and another for a side, upper-deck view) for the sum of over $500 only to have to sell two for a $100 loss.\n\nThe stadium is also frigid-cold in the winter.  Considering that they have a dome, they open it (probably wanting to save money instead of heating it) and the Western sun blinds (but warms... and even tans!) those in the upper Eastern side.  So, if you are sitting on the Eastern side (especially in the upper portion), bring sunglasses and/ or a hat.  Wherever you are sitting outside of the hot months, bring some warm clothes!\n\nIn all, I enjoyed the stadium and look forward to my next visit.  I hope that my tips help you to have the insight that I wished that I had!"""""""
One,"Won't be going back.\n\nThe food was so so.  The Front of the House was a disaster.\n\nWe arrived early.  With no real bar area we were taken out back to the fire pit area and told a server would be a long to get us drinks.  After waiting 15 minutes, I went in and ordered myself.\n\nWe were eventually seated 30 minutes after our reservation.  They were then out of the entree I had chosen.\n\nThe courses came very slowly.  We had to send back my wife's entree as it was undercooked.\n\nThe only highlight was the pasta dish.\n\nThere are many better choices out there."
Three,"With a name like Mastro's in the name you can be assured that you will be satisfied. And satisfied we were on our annual outing with the Gumina family. Great food, good people and an all around great time. \n\nThe staff was very quick to take care of us, our server was perfect and very attentive. Initially I was a little put off that they set our table in the lounge area, rather than the normal dining area. But I quickly changed my mind, as our group were a loud bunch and we were perfectly located. \n\nThe food was all great! The cocktail prices are nothing outrageous. Everything from the seafood tower to the Halibut were great. (side note: the steak at City Hall is better, in my opinion) The dessert was my favorite part for sure. Everything was out of this world good. i wasn't sure where I was going to fit it in my stomach but I made room somehow, because after one bite of the butter cake and crembrule I was hooked."
Five,"Went back for the sixth time and it's still one of my favorite places in Phoenix.  Of course, I left the gift card my brother gave me for xmas at home, but oh well, another excuse to go back again.  This was my first hot stone massage at the Fairmont and it was one of the best.  The services are all great, but what I love is the complete experience.  Booking one service gets you access to the entire gym and spa for the day.  Take advantage of it and get there hours before your service.  I like to work out for 1-2hrs, then soak in the waterfall hot tub.  Head up to the roof to the pool and chill in a cabana that can be closed (encompassing two lounge chairs) for some privacy, or just swim and relax.  I was told they are building a nice bar (complete with alcohol) this summer, which will be a nice treat.  \n\nThe men's facility is amazing.  There's a eucalyptus inhalation room, jacuzzi, and Swiss shower, plus plenty of regular showers, shaving areas, and great apples and beverages.  After cleaning up, I get my services, then shower again and hang out by the pool for a bit longer.  \n\nMy only dissatisfaction is the food.  Don't bother getting it from the spa, it's terrible.  I've tried it twice and it failed to please both times.  That being said, be sure to ask for the specials when you book because there are always deals going on.  Also, sign up for the President's club when you arrive (it's free and you get 10% off future services)."
Three,"I am a big fan of Fuddruckers because I am a big fan of burgers. This chain is pretty good at what they do.\n\nBurgers: a 7/10 in taste but what do you expect from a chain. The portions are generally large ranging from 1/3 lbs to 1 lb I believe and the smaller of the choices with fries is usually enough for most.\n\nAtmosphere: It is similar to a TGI Fridays, Applebees or Chilis except this Fuddruckers does not have a whole lot of booths which bothers me because if I have a choice between comfortable semiprivate seating and middle of the room on a hard piece of wood I go with the former.\n\nAlso this Fuddruckers is not dirty but it is not as clean as I would like.\n\nWhen I am hunkering for a burger done right this is on the list of options."
Two,"I recently visited Los Reyes de la Torta.  This was my second visit, which was definitely disappointing compared to the first.  The aguas here are DELISH!! They make a great summer drink, especially in this AZ heat.  I had the agua de sandia (watermelon), and my boyfriend tried the agua de fresa (strawberry) cremosa.  For the cremosa drinks they mix it with Carnation and sweet cream, and I have to say this is one of the thickest ones I've had before.  We ordered the queso fundido with jalapenos which I was really looking forward to.  However, this was a huge disappointment.  The waitress placed the plate down and I noticed that they served it with tortillas rather than tortilla chips.  I grabbed a piece of the tortilla, and went to scoop up some gooey queso fundido...except it wasn't gooey.  It was a gelatinous, almost solid bowl of cheese.  This didn't seem right to me.  We asked the waitress to warm it up some more, but it came back the same.  After asking her about it, she said they don't serve your traditional queso fundido.  They use mozzarella cheese which doesn't really melt to well...For dinner I had an order of the coctel de camaron (shrimp cocktail).  They are very generous with the shrimp.  Actually that's all that was really in there.  I would have preferred a little more avocado and  to have some cucumber in there was well.  I wouldn't mind giving this place another shot, especially for their awesome aguas."
Three,"I love to hang out here and just look at the place. This is an old Bank of America that has been transformed into a kinda cool kind hip place for the scenestas to chill. They have preserved a lot of the architecture and added their own touches to make this place, in my opinion, a unique place to come for food and drinks. The food here is OK-they have some unique creations that you're bound to enjoy. They also serve up some tasty cocktails and have a nice selection of beer. The enclosed patio is really cool and the bocce ball court back there lends itself to some fun times. I'm giving three stars because while the food is good, it's not great. And the attitude from some of the servers is at times cold if not snobby. I know you work in a cool place, but come on-lose the attitude. Despite that, this is a fun place to hang and definitely worth a visit."
Five,"""Coming from Texas I had high expectations....and Mastro's exceeded my wildest expectations!   Wet aged beef is my new gold standard for prime beef!  The bone in rib eye was the BEST I have ever eaten, and the unique bone-in filet was very flavorful and very unique!   The mac-in-cheese was the ideal accompaniment to our meal and the house salad was the perfect prelude!\n\nIn Fort Worth & Dallas we regard Bob's Steak and CHop House as well as Del Frisco's as the \go-to\"""" prime steak houses.......Mastro's has easily eclipsed both of these fine benchmarks."""""""
Four,"Went here with a bunch of friends. The place was recommended to me. It was my first time eating hand-pulled noodles. I always see it on TV and have always wanted to try it out. I ordered a noodle soup with beef. The noodles, I will agree, are very good. I'm so used to eating dehydrated noodles for years from a can or at restaurants. This was a treat. The meat quality was not great, in fact, the majority of my beef was just cartilage. But with noodles so good, I didn't look to having meat to distract me. I would definitely go back and try another dish, preferably vegetarian so that I can focus on the noodles again."
One,"""This was the most HORRIBLE floor cleaning I have ever seen!!!!! We took before and after pictures and cannot tell the difference at all! The guy was not friendly and just wanted our money even though he did not do his job! I would NEVER recommend this company to anyone. We paid $1000 and got $20 worth of service. I mopped the floor the day after the cleaning guy was here and got a lot of the \staining as he would say\"""" off easily. I have included a picture that we wrote in the floor with a paper towel after the cleaning....can you read the saying? That is exctaly how we felt after the service. REALLY?!?!?"""""""
Four,"I came here yesterday with my family for an early father's day lunch. I had the strawberry chicken salad, but added goat cheese. The poppyseed dressing  was awesome. The waitress said they make all of their dressings in house and they're all vinegar based. I appreciate their homestyle, more health conscious approach. Everything seemed very fresh and light. \n\nI was also fortunate enough to try the brownies and chocolate hazelnut bars. Both were delicious and able to satisfy my chocolate craving sweet tooth. \n\nThe service was also great. My brother was over an hour late and she was very cool about keeping his food warm until he came and us staying and talking for a while after we were finished. I would definitely come back."
Five,"""When I lived here eight years ago, El Paso was the don when it came to pork ribs....I still use it as my standard.

Until I get proven otherwise, it's still my #1.\n\nThe ribs are the \""""fall off the bone\"""" variety. And what I like about El Paso is their ribs \""""glisten!\"""" Great word, huh!  Some rib places bake them or grill them and then slather them with sauce just before they serve it. Now there are some styles of ribs that use rubs which usually don't have sauces, but if you're looking for the glistening kind, then try El Paso.\n\nI don't work there and can't tell you their exact methods but if you're looking for great ribs, El Paso is the place. Now...since I've moved back to Scottsdale, yes their prices have gone up and  I noticed their portions aren't as big, but they're still the best I've had. There are a couple of places in town that are very close. Look for their reviews on my profile. El Paso isn't usually filled so the food usually gets to you fairly quickly and I like their jalopena corn bread as well. Not as good as Boston Market's but good. It's got a slightly sweet outside texture and warm inside, great with butter! mmmmm"""""""
Four,"Sapporo is a nice place to get your sushi fix. And by nice I simply mean that the food is fresh, and well priced. I'm not going to tell you that the rolls are amazing, the nigiri mind blowing, and the alternative menu super creative... But I promise that you will leave glad that you ate here.\n\nHappy hour is easily one of the best deals around, sushi or otherwise. Half priced sushi and drinks are something I will always adore, especially when well executed, and in the case of the cocktails, strong. \n\nLook, you can find better sushi at a lot of places, but more often than not, a heck of a lot worse (sushi brokers, Ra, stingray). If you're in the area, stomach begging for that soy and wasabi kick and a couple bombers, patronize sapporo, you won't be disappointed! And the edamame is done right too...with tons of sea salt."
Four,"Yummy! This place was fantastic from the moment we stepped inside. The decor, wait staff, food...absolutely top notch! Our waiter knew exactly what he was talking about and explained the dishes to us in detail without any hesitation. We ordered an order of regular caesar salad and the spicy mambo caesar salad to start, which were very good. The spicy mambo version had wasabi in it so it definately had a a great kick. I had the sea scallops which were sauteed and drenched in a luxuriously creamy white sauce....absolutely divine! I can still taste it in my mouth! LOL. Hubby ordered the sea bass which was really tender as well. Overall had a very nice, last night in Scottsdale and I would recommend this place for a nice, romantic, elegant evening out!"
Four,"""Ok, so we know it's a chain and have seen plenty of locations everywhere. I'm giving a full 4 stars for this location because of the manager on duty the day I visited. The employees were all kept busy and the orderliness of the place showed that. I was hesitant to try the fish tacos because I'm just getting into fish (kinda) and usually chicken-out, literally, when it comes to tacos! But, the manager was so friendly and helpful and descriptive of what I would find when I tried the special, that I couldn't resist. Glad I couldn't! Delish, even for being \slightly fishy\"""", and a nice spicy flavor with the mango salsa relish stuff!"""""""
Five,"It really couldn't have been any better.  \n\n-Groupon (check)\n-Cool unpretentious waiter (check)\n-Live music (check)\n-Amazing menu (double check)\n\nWe ventured over to 5th & Wine a few weeks ago after buying our Groupon online for $15 bucks (for $30 worth of food) and haven't stopped talking about it since.  We're not really wine drinkers (craft beer is more our style), so we decided to just focus on the food and order as much as our little stomachs could handle.  Here's what we got and why it was so fabulous:\n\n-Bruschetta.  Next time we go back I think I want to order nothing but the bruschetta, it was that good.  Melt in your mouth savory and soft and just all around a perfect explosion of both texture and flavor.  We only got four of the eight bruschetta offerings, (Apples and brie, Peppercorn steak and horseradish, Tomato basil and mozzarella, and Prosciutto and fig) but each and every one that we tried left our mouth watering.\n\n-5th & Wine burger.  We asked our waiter about this burger, and he said it was one of the best burgers he has ever had.  We took this comment with a grain of salt since he works for the joint, but after we sank our teeth into the juicy beast ourselves, we realized how right he was.  It was a damn good burger, well deserving of praise.  The fries on the side were also finger lickin' good and we gobbled up every last one of those perfectly fried taters.\n\n-Tomato and Mozzarella panini.  It was everything I thought a panini could be, and more. Crispy on the outside and gooey guts of tomato and cheese on the inside, this was one tasty sandwich, and the side of minestrone soup hit the spot as well.\n\nI wish other mediocre establishments would observe and take notes from this place on how to run a successful restaurant in the valley.  The food, the service and the atmosphere are all impeccable, and unlike some other places, they don't make you pay for valet parking or dress like a wannabe hipster to fit in and look cool (I'm looking at you Postino)."
Five,"Superior dining experience in a stunning Japanese-inspired interior.\n\nWhere to begin? Why not the bathrooms: the walls in the bathrooms are entirely swathed in tan, textured granite. The countertops have a rounded, raw Nakakima-style lip and the tops are unfinished in a nod to pure nature. Even the grout surrounding the goddamn urinal is flawless.\n\nStep outside into the main restaurant and you'll find a very large robata style grill with European guys pushing out beautiful, flawless grilled dishes that smell like heaven. For fun, sit at the grill in mid-century, tan leather chairs and take it all in. Feel your mouth agape as you watch lobster-sized Madagascar shrimp being grilled, sliced, and sent out like pictures in a frame.\n\nMy food was excellent and service was attentive and professional. One of my all-time favorite dining experiences."
Three,"Oh dear me, how the mighy have fallen!\n\nA year ago I would've proudly given this place 5 stars but the last 6 or 7 times I've been here it just hasn't been as good. I don't know if its the different people doing the cooking or what but the standards seem to have slipped. Back a couple years ago when I started going there a beefy guy was doing the cooking, always made quality pizza. Now? Not so much! The semi-surly lady from Jersey (sorry Tom T., she's from Jersey) is still there on occassion though. Bring back the beefy guy who can cook please!!\n\nI still love the chicken parm despite the downslope on the pizza, it's a massive sandwich and definitely makes me happy...\n\nAll in all I will keep going back hoping that the pizza will get back to where it once was..."
Five,"""I went to Stinkweeds today with a mp3 recording I made off of an internet radio station two years ago. A station from LA used a collage of music in an intro that included a literally 3 second piece of a song, no kidding. I hesitated for so long thinking it would be impossible to identify the artist and when I first played it for Lindsey she exclaimed with a sly smile was \Is this a test\""""  but with only two listenings  she was able to identify the Go Teams \""""Do It Right\"""" without the use of the internet thus ending my two year trek.

Four,"""Stopped in here today as I was in the area and it was kinda gloomy weather, perfect for pho!  I'm a fan of Pho Van down the road and wanted to compare this place.  I only get Pho Ga (chicken) and it seems that it always tastes pretty much the same no matter where I go, so all I can really compare/rate is the service and the \extras\"""".  By extras, I mean the tasty goodness that you put into pho - like cilantro, onions, bean sprouts, limes, etc.\n\nService was good, quick and friendly.\n\nThen came the extras.  A mound of bean sprouts (good start), 3 slices fresh jalapeno (good), 1 slice lime (so-so) but no onions or cilantro (bad news).  I asked the server for cilantro and onions.  She hesitated for a second, then nodded, but still seemed surprised at my request (wha?! what pho place doesn't give you cilantro and onions??).\n\nShe brought my bowl of steaming hot pho, still no cilantro and onions, but I did see that there was a layer of cilantro and onions floating in the soup.  I guess that will have to do.\n\nI had to ask for soy sauce.  (Wha?! What pho place doesn't have soy sauce on the table??)\n\nSO, overall, VERY delicious (I don't think I left a single drop of broth in that bowl), but I was a little miffed by the lack of \""""extras\"""".  For $6.75 though, a good meal and I would come in again."""""""
Three,"""Okay, after a few more visits to Giligin's (I don't know how I keep letting \Nette\"""" talk me into it!) I have to say it is quite entertaining.

Four,"Blow out bars take note. This is how it's done.\n\nThe space is ultra engaging--a fun experience overall aside from the quality of the blowout. The staff are professional from the point of making a reservation all the way through checkout (and a followup).\n\nI was offered a variety of drinks upon arrival and checked in quite promptly. A stylist greeted me, introduced herself, all standard fare. She sat me down to discuss what I wanted, we went through a book of styles together, discussed some modifications and I felt fully confident about her (Zoey) knowledge before I even got the shampoo.\n\nOnce the blow out started, Zoey told me exactly how she was going to proceed, made just enough small talk and asked me how I liked what she doing as she went along. She used several products before the blow out and the style is STILL going after nights of sleeping on it.\n\nAt checkout, I was offered a savings menu without being pressured at all into it. \n\nDryBar features style and substance. This place is a hike for me and in the end, I'll land there several times.\n\nLove."
Four,"Lisa G is now open for dinner on Wed-Fri nights. I went here earlier tonight and I gotta say, cool little joint they've got goin' here. Situated in an old house off 7th Ave, Lisa G's has a modern interior and a really friendly, trendy staff. My friend and I tasted a few wines at the bar before sitting down for dinner. \r\n\r\nGranted Lisa G's still has only its salad, appetizer, and sandwich menu, but we decided to split three of the dishes: the Frutti de Mare salad, the Empanadas, and the Skewer Plate. All were really good and reasonably priced, as were our glasses of Malbec. But the best was dessert - a Devil's Food Chocolate Cake with vanilla bean gelato. Excelllleeent (TM Mr.Burns). \r\n\r\nGreat friendly atmosphere inside. I dug this place a lot, especially since it's kind of off the beaten path . Definitely a spot worth checking out if you're in Central Phoenix. The only downside I'd say is that, like My Florist Cafe, there really isn't a menu more dinner appropriate, but hey, Lisa G's made up for it in other ways. \r\n\r\nWill be back."
Five,"I was here about a month ago looking for this George Foreman grill.  I could not find it on the shelf so I was told to go to Customer Service for a rain check because it was on sell.  Chris at Customer Service look at the ad and checked his hand held device.  He told me to wait a second.  3 mins later, he came back with one.  YEAH, CHRIS!!!!  \n\nEvery time I am at this Target, someone always greets me or ask if I needed help.  Love this place!!!!"
Four,"Liberty Market just has the freshest ingredients!  You can literally see how they make and prepare your food in their open kitchen!  The service is very friendly and efficient.  My son loved their Smoked Salmon plate for both breakfast and for lunch.  I had the Caprese salad with a side of sweet custardy bread pudding!   Whenever I look forward to the dessert, I almost usually order salad for dinner.  I guess that cancels the calories out...my own theory, anyway.  My husband had the Salmon BLT and enjoyed it.  We're disappointed with their pizza, though.  Thus 4 stars instead of 5.   The Sicilian is so doughy and too thick and lacked any taste whatsoever.  My son did not like it at all.  Tonight I figured their wood fired pizza would be better, but didn't pass my son's test.  He said it had too much parmesan.   He cracks me up.  He prefers more fresh mozzarella.  It also lacked the zing in their sauce.  Not a very good left over either because it fell apart and got really soggy.  Their Asian Salad is great topped with beets...with a side of chocolate cupcake.   They don't sell much in their market or it's seasonal items only.    NO KIDS MEAL, but they have a few kid friendly on their regular menu.  Great neighborhood place to eat!"
Five,"This is the greatest watch repair shop I have ever been to in my entire life. Have had the same Rolex watch since high school. The watch and I have been to repair shops in Houston, Dallas, and Atlanta. When I arrived at the shop, it was closed. They weren't open that day. However, the owner was there and so he agreed to look at my watches. Already, a great customer service experience. He fixed a digital watch, had me set it, and before I could even finish he was done with the clasp on my Rolex. There was no charge on the Rolex. Really? It's my favorite watch; I would have paid anything. This guy is fast, honest, and affordable."
Three,"The place is small,  cute and clean. The display case is so pretty. I sampled 3 flavors. And one of them was bland. I finally went with the Carmelo it was ok not very tasty but for almost 5$ I got a very small scoop but it's so rich it filled me up. I like texture with my ice cream this place has no mix ins but a few flavors have nuts or something in them. In order to enhance the flavor of some other flavors the counter girl suggests mixing flavors but of course that's another 1$ or more. \n\nI'd probably take a friend there cause it has a cool name and the case is so pretty but I would not be a regular"
Three,"I just tried Rocket Burger for the first time after reading some great things on here, but it didn't quite match my expectations.\n\nThe main reason that I think this place is rated too high is that the food is just average. The sauce on the burger is nice, but there is nothing else really special about the burger and the fries are kind of lousy.\n\nThe service however is pretty good. The guys working here are certainly friendly, so I am all for supporting an independent location like this. The various sodas they have here are cool to look at, but a little overwhelming. I couldn't figure out what to get or what was supposed to be good, so I just stuck with a regular fountain Pepsi.\n\nThe location of the place is not very good and it looks more like a convenient store than a restaurant. That was one thing I didn't like about eating here. It was an alright experience on the whole though."
Five,"This review is written by a former skeptic--thinking Boot Camp would consist of aerobic dancing and yoga. . . \n\nI was mistaken.  The Ultimate Body Boot Camp (UBBC) is an intense, fast paced full body workout that is often grueling.  It rivals 2 a day football practices, condensed into an hour.  Within 4 weeks, I saw dramatic improvements in both cardiovascular endurance and strength, and quickly lost weight.  \n\nIt is never boring, and Richelle is great and highly amusing.  The one nit--6:30 a.m. or 7 p.m. classes por favor!\n\nI recommend!"
Four,"""My friend and I split a Steak & Tendon small pho and a banh xeo. We were both very satisfied and full after this meal. This is the best banh xeo that I've had in Arizona so far. If you've never had a banh xeo before, it's like a Vietnamese style crepe/omelette. The outer part is egg, and inside contains: bean sprouts, meat (pork, I believe), and shrimp. You cut a piece of it, and then wrap it around the large lettuce leaves. Then you dip the lettuce wrapped crepe into the fish sauce, and enjoy.\n\nI LOVE LOVE LOVE BANH XEO! If you've never heard of it, or tried it before, I highly recommend it. Share with a friend if you're scared to try new things. If you're adventurous, try it on its own, I think it's very filling and can serve as a meal. \n\nThe pho is ordinary, but other members of my party were jipped on some meats that were supposed to be included in their soup. Small size is definitely enough, even if the waiter thinks it's a \children size.\"""" Service was okay, but I'd definitely come again, just for the banh xeo. :)"""""""
Three,"Actually, sometimes this place is a four..or a five, but overall I'd give it a three.\n\nAnywho..  I tend to come here often.  We first came here because we had eaten at San Carlos Bay three times that past week and decided to give another mariscos place a try.\n\nWith each meal you get a small bowl of chips (more than one bowl will cost you extra).  I'm not a fan of the salsa, but I eat it anyway.  It's mostly liquid and a little spicy for me, and I think it has the consistency of that Chinese soup I don't know the name of.  I've ordered several different things, such as the camar\u00f3nes al mojo de ajo (shrimp in garlic sauce), which isn't the best, but if you take out the shrimp, eat them separately, and then mix the sauce, rice, and beans together you get a strange concoction of awesomeness.  I've also ordered ceviche tostadas, which are good but HUGE (two was too many), as well the shrimp soup (caldo).  This was very good.  My husband tends to order the whole baked snapper pretty often (it's cheaper here than at San Carlos Bay, if you're into whole fish...), and sometimes they'll top it with shrimp for free.\n\nThe BEST thing about this place is that they often (but not always) will give you each a free appetizer.  You usually get a choice of either seven mares soup or a tiny bowl of ceviche, both of which are good with the chips.  I will say though, that before I started coming here I used to HATE soup.  Somehow the seven mares appetizer soup has turned me onto other soups (the shrimp soup here, same thing but less seafood, Japanese udon, and the lagman at Golden Valley Uzbek).\n\nIf you come on a Friday (and probably Saturdays, as well), you'll likely encounter karaoke night, which is often entertaining.  Unfortunately, this is also the reason for three stars.  Several times the karaoke was so loud we couldn't talk to each other and had to sit there awkwardly staring at the television.  Other times, though, the volume is totally fine.  \n\nThis place also has a bar to sit and watch a game, and sells raw fish and other seafood as well (including ceviche) that you can just take home to cook.  Another mention is that the service is usually a little too good.  Checking on us every three minutes good.  But that's definitely better than never and the waitresses are always nice and helpful ;) \n\nI think they have pretty good happy hour specials here, but we're never in time for them.  Someday I'll try a margarita."
Three,"""3.5- This is one of those places that I would be happy going to once every couple of years or so. While I liked the food, it's not something that I see myself craving on a constant basis. The fry bread itself was fresh, chewy and tasted eerily similar to a traditional Chinese breakfast staple called  called \You Tiao,\"""" which is a fried bread in the shape of a stick, rather than the round shape of the Native American \""""fry bread\"""" served at The Fry Bread House. \n\nWe tried 2 varieties of the fry bread tacos as well as a sweet fry bread while we stopped here during our roadtrip to the Southwest: chorizo taco, ultimate combo taco and fry bread w/ honey. Again, no complaints about the bread really, but the fillings actually kind of took away from the tastiness of the fry bread. The chorizo was the better of the two \""""tacos.\"""" The meat was spicy and abundant. However, the ultimate combo taco filling was a let-down. There was hardly any beef-- there was way too much refried beans, and it just did not pair well with the fry bread. The sogginess of the filling weighed the bread down. \n\nThe sweet fry bread was very tasty and dripping with honey. However, I was feeling really bloated by the time I got to this portion of the meal-- you see, whatever fry bread I consumed seemed to have expanded at least 3 times in my stomach...\n\nSo overall, worth a stop for the curiosity factor. But now I know if I ever wanted to eat Native American \""""fry bread\"""" again, I can just buy some You Tiao from the local Asian grocery and experience pretty much the same taste again."""""""
One,"""Lunched here today. We used a \Living Social\"""" coupon, which obviously confused the lady who was running the register. As a result of her confusion, she charged my debit card for the whole amount, then had to refund it, then had to charge it again, and somehow came up with a different amount that I owed every time. \n\nThe second strike against this place was that it took 45 minutes from the time we ordered our four tacos until we actually received them. \n\nThird strike, the food was below average in my opinion. I had the beef taco and the carnitas taco, both super greasy meat, with less than impressive flavors. The salsa was ok. My sister had the AZ super taco and the shrimp taco, her were better than mine, but still not fabulous. \n\nAdd those three strikes to the fact that they have a very cramped little parking lot and that pretty much left me knowing that I won't be heading back there anytime soon... or ever."""""""
Three,"I don't know what to make of this place.  I think people in Phoenix, especially in this area, have lost the common sense and therefore customer service gene.  On one hand, they asked our large party if we wanted to split our bills for each person.  Guess they're used to it with business parties and what not.  So that was cool.  Every single other person was a dickhead though.  Ah well. \n\nThey get points for good tzatziki and pita.  I ordered pastitio.  WHY DO YOU MESS UP PERFECTLY GOOD PASTITIO WITH TOMATO SAUCE JUST NO NO NO NO!  No.  Ok?  Got it?  Good.  The gyro platter looked very good.  That's about it."
Five,"""I thought this place was great for the kids, and has great photo ops.  We took the mine tour, the guide was hilarious and very informative, answered all my kids crazy questions.  Although the mine and elevator are fake my kids didn't realize it, and they thought it was one of the \coolest\"""" things ever.  Most of the attractions were closed due to rain, but the clouds and scenery were absolutely amazing because of it.  We did the reptile room, a bit over priced, but again the kids liked it.  They have a church there that holds mass every Sunday at 11:30, so if your into the religious thing it would probably be a pretty neat thing to attend.  We skipped the restaurant due to checking out the menu on line before we left, and the prices were pretty outrageous, and after reading other reviews about the food on here I am glad we did.  If your heading east on the 60 to get there, there are a couple of other burger places to eat at before you go.  We did stop at the bakery and purchased a cinnamon roll that was really good, they heated it back up for us before they served it, some sort of apple crisp thing, and a chocolate chip cookie, skip the cookie, but everything else was good.  Also we got an italian soda the was horrible, stick with the bottled water.  All in all it was fun, the kids really enjoyed it, and I will go back again.  I hear in July they have a Cowboy/girl day filled with fun activities for the kids, not sure about the heat, but I will give it a go."""""""
Three,"I posted a review out of frustration and disappointment and was ready to not return to this business.

So, after a short hiatus my partner and I returned, genuinely hoping to be pleasantly surprised. Thankfully, we were not disappointed! There is a new KM who has swiftly addressed the food quality consistancy. Omg, we have had some delightful flavors that have lingered and tempted us to return again 2 nights later. Theron, the bartender has delivered quality and charm and has made our experience wonderful. Leigha, our server is always attentive, thoughtful, and gracious.

Lola, you put something in your coffee that sends a spark of energy to my brain and makes me work like a madwomen for the rest of the day! \n\nI really like this location. It has a lot of character and reminds me of a coffee shop I'd find in Portland or SF. It's not huge inside, but everyone seems to coexist comfortably together and it's an easy spot to have a meeting or do some work. \n\nThey put something delicious and addicting in their iced coffee. I ordered the non-fat iced vanilla latte and I was happy for the rest of the day. The coffee was creamy, not too strong and perfectly chilled. I could have had four more but that would have been bad news. \n\nI will dream about coffee beans until my next visit for that addicting iced latte."
Four,"This place looks like it might be shabby from the outside, but when you walk in it's a legit wine bar! Their mozzarella sticks are REALLY good, seriously I have never had mozzarella sticks that good before. I've had the Eggplant Parmesan rolls (or something like that), Pasta Greek and of course the Chicken pasta with pesto/alfredo sauce which were all flavorful and delicious! Portions are very generous; I end up always having leftovers! Their house wines are actually not too shabby either. I don't think you'll be finding any Liberty Creek here! It's really good, but can be a bit pricey, so you'll definitely want to make it a once-in-a-while thing. Still, it's really damn good!"

I happened to do all three here even though the wedding was in San Diego.  Every time I was in and out quickly.  Only needed a couple of adjustments when I tried the suit on at pickup.  None of the wedding party had any real issues even though we dealt with a total of about 6 stores.

Three,"I've had to travel through Phoenix a couple times recently because I was stupid enough to fly on US Air.\n\nCons:\n1. It's huge and it seems like it takes forever to get from point A to B, which can be annoying when US Air cancels your flight and you're running around trying to find a way to get back to Seattle.\n\n2. I swear there are US Air employees hawking credit cards like every 10 feet.  It gets annoying.\n\nPros:\n1. There is this place called the Blue Burrito Grill and it kicks the butt of all other airport food.  They're super fast and we had an amazingly good chicken burrito there last time."
Five,"this place is fantastic!  A family run joint with amazing food and huge portions.  La is wonderful, it's her joint.  Her daughter Lisa is an amazing server and aspiring Nurse.  \n\nIf you know ANYTHING about Thai culture or food, this is the real thing!  I can't recommend this place more highly than the five stars YELP allows!\n\nKeep in mind that level 4 (Thai hot) is HOT!  I like it that way, but if you don't have an iron stomach, stick with 2 Medium!\n\nThey don't serve booze, but the Jasmin Tea is served in it's own pot, and is authentic and worth trying, even if  you don't like tea.\n\nThe wontons are unique and delicious.  The yellow curry is something you order extra portions just to take home with you.\n\nPark in the back as there is plenty of room.  \n\nThis place is on the top of my list. \n\nYou leave full and feeling good!"
Four,"The huge group and I loved this place because we are out of towners... they must treat the out of towners differently because we didn't hate the place like a lot of the reviews down there. They must be pretty well off to offer us two free desserts and they did with many other parties! The place is such a fun environment. \n\nMan I was in love with the ahi tuna wrap. It was huge, good thing I split it with someone else. I think we paid around $13 for it, and it had so much ahi in it... very worth the price!! And sooooooo good. I'm usually not a huge fan of wraps because they're kinda boring but this wrap had all of the perfect mixings and dressings in it. My god, we had a great dinner there... ordered those huge tall beer thingies as well. \n\nI'm really glad we came in here with a huge group because we all had fun amongst ourselves and drank a lot... we also had the excitement of being on vacation. I think that if you're here to just have a nice meal, the place can seem annoying after a little while.\n\nThis sounds really weird but their cotton candy was the best cotton candy I've ever tasted. It's like strawberry flavored or something... not like other cotton candy that just tastes like plain sugar. \n\nTwo from our party rode the mechanical bull... it was kind of amusing I guess, haha. It wasn't as exciting as how you see it in movies/tv shows.\n\nToo bad they don't let in people under 21during dinner time... this place is a restaurant.. what if the younger people wanna eat?!"
Three,"Thought I'd give Thai a try after reading some of the Y reviews.  I've been to Thailand and taken cooking courses there and so I must say I am a little jaded.  With that said I thought their version of Kang Karie was good, nicely balanced flavor to the curry, but the chicken was dry, as I find it seems to be everywhere.  The noodle dish was a bit difficult to maneuver, as the noodles were all glued together, but once we cut them all up it was manageable and the Chinese sausage added an interesting dimension of flavor with it's classic 5 spice taste.  The garnish of celery threw me for a loop, but I think I'm nit picking that one.  I liked that they offered two sizes of servings, especially since we were eating a very late lunch and had plans for dinner and did not want that spoiled."
Five,"Reflective of the vibrant and diverse SWIHA spirit, SWINA creates an elegant ambience of spa luxury for the savvy beauty seeker. If you are ready to receive a wellness focused beauty treatment at a very affordable rate, I highly recommend you gift yourself the experience of a $33 facial - YES, that is correct, only $33!!! And the value in the laser treatments just might make you jump up and down! Seriously!\n\nPlus, SWINA is privately owned and operated, I think we can all value the importance of supporting locally owned businesses. With that said, this educational facility graciously blends beautiful d\u00e9cor with the most sought-after amenities providing a genuine luxury that feels uniquely borne of SWINA - it's easy to forget that you are in an atmosphere that is dedicated to teaching future beauty and wellness practitioners the way to professionally meet and customize the needs of each individual client. I notice that every guest is made to feel at home in an intimate style of service that is personal, natural and memorable. The way service is supposed to be!\n\nI have very sensitive skin, and a low tolerance for pain, therefore I must make note that the practitioners here are very gentle and precise in the way in which they  facilitate the services. They actually care that I am at ease and always succeed  to create a comfortable and effective treatment.\n \nNext greatest thing - the products they use are AMAZING PROFESSIONAL PRODUCTS, not the kind (in fact many professional products are the kind...) that are full of chemicals that harm your skin rather than heal or rejuvenate the skin! That's important, right?\n\nI also love that they are ideally located with super easy access to the major freeways, and parking is a breeze and always free - Go visit, you will be delighted  you did!\n\nOh - and if you are thinking you might want to become a professional, this is by far going to be your best choice. Visit, and you will see why."
Three,"Well Pete's Fish and Chips,\nI'm mean its good I defiantly go there a few times here and there.  Im sad to see a long list of ok reviews.  I don't think this place is trash but defiantly not a big time restaurant.  Fish and Chips is a classic meal and Pete's success is in its following.   I took a trip to England and made sure I tried out a few places there.  Its all about the breading and fresh fish.  Sad to say reviewers are right about the frozen taste.  Defiantly not a fresh catch of the day here.  Breading and fish just has that very commercial taste.  Pete must have forgotten to put the love in the food.  Hopefully the reviews will speak loud enough for the owners to hear.  I hope to review again one day with better news.\n\nDear Pete's Fish and Chips,\nWhy such low stars, why so few reviews. Please don't say to your self the ok response is fault of the reviewers.  Pete your locations are popular and well known, why settle for ok, A few bright ideas here and there should do the trick. \n\nSincerely,\nyelpers"
Three,"We got take-out and they were very short-handed. It was very busy on  a Sat night and they only had two servers that also doubled as a hostess. What was supposed to take 20 minutes to get our food took 35 minutes. We also had to return the food because what was supposed to be a #1 spicy was actually more like a #3. My husband, who loves spicy, couldn't even eat what was supposed to be the most mild. When I went back (after first calling them 15 minutes before to notify them I was coming in), I waited in the lobby for 10 minutes before being acknowledged. The lady responded that they were busy and seemed inconvenienced by me. I was the one who had to drive back and get my meal remade! I was very disappointed at the response and reluctance to fix the issue. The remake of the Beef Salad was slightly less spicy but at least we could eat it. I really enjoyed the entree but having my food wrong the first time and the bad customer service ruined the experience. We also had the fried appetizer sampler that was just okay. My husband goes there very frequently and loves this place. The portions are very large and prices very reasonable. I will go back and hopefully, this one experience was an isolated one."
Two,"""With dreams of starting my own cupcake business I was excited to visit Sprinkles.  ESPECIALLY after watching her week after week on Cupcake Wars.\n\nLet.  Down.\n\nThe cupcakes you get from the grocery store have better, more light and fluffy, frosting.  The cake was moist - but the cake part of a cupcake is only half the experience.  It is also the \simple\"""" half.  If you do not have \""""mixins\"""" in the batter, it is pretty easy to make moist and delicious cake.  \n\nOverall it was not worth the drive or the price.

Five,"""I love AJ's but some are better than others and some have really gone downhill.  THis one is always the shining star, and I will drive to it from just about anywhere.  Dennis the wine buyer/seller is the best in the business.  Talk to him.  Trust him.  Use him for all his wonderful winey wisdom!  Really the whole store has a great energy.. you can tell the staff is happy there and actually want to help you.  Go more than twice and someone will remember you and say hi.  And this one has the biggest selection in Scottsdale from what I can tell.  Yes, AJ's is more expensive than Food City.  But if you tend to buy high quality food/cooking items, you'll probably find they have the best deals on what you're looking for.  I'm a fan of Whole Foods too, and honestly they probably have better fish and meat... but for \speciality\"""" items, AJ's is the place."""""""
Four,"Rosita's Place Rocks! It has the right amount of dive atmosphere with just excellent food. The green & red sauce are both pretty hot and spicy Chips are fresh and fried on premises. All entrees are quite big and enough to feed two. It draws interesting crowd. I was there with some folks from work after a conference and so were in suits. There were some families, retired folks, emo-kids and bubbas. Try the combination burro with enchilada sauce. Can't go wrong with that. Beer and tequila is reasonably price."
Two,"""I like spicy. I mean I like to sweat from the bridge of my nose when I eat. When they asked how hot I wanted my green curry chicken, I did a double take. \Isn't green curry spicy by definition?\"""" They told me they make it in varying degrees of spiciness for the ASU crowd. While I disagree with diluting the authenticity of the traditional preparation, I get it - they have a business to run. What I really don't like is how they do it. They make a mild green curry...er, no, green sauce. Then, upon ordering, they add a certain amount of red chili flakes depending on how spicy you want it. This is not only upsetting philosophically, but chili flakes need time to cook in a curry - you don't just drop in, stir and serve. I get the sense that this problem is rampant in Arizona; hope to find a solution soon."""""""
Five,"Great place! Glad I moved around the corner from Tott's in South Tempe.\nI used to go to Tott's all of the time when I worked around the corner from their old location on Guadalupe/McClintock. When our company moved, I stopped going so I am glad I found them again! \n\nAwesome Food and Great Service! Young has always been really nice and so has the other staff.\n\nThe Highlights for me:\n- Great Service! The staff has always been really polite and friendly\n- The food is always Excellent and the price is really good for the portion you get. \n- Egg Drop Soup (only $2) - Always Piping hot and doesn't have nearly as much Sodium as other Asian places.\n- Kung Pao Chicken - Great flavors, not too saucy and the Chili Peppers have a smoky flavor that I can probably pop them on its own all-day long. \n- The Curries - Bangkok & Singapore are really good! I usually get the Chicken or Beef and a side of brown rice. Much better then the local Thai restaurants who serve Curries. \n\nOverall, Glad I found them again and Keep banging out Quality food and great service!"
Five,Dr. Gundermen is the man! He is the only Chiro I have ever been to that I enjoy 100%. You get a nice massage before the adjustment. You get asked questions. Get to ask questions too. Dr. Gundermen explains everything and tells you what's wrong.  Very friendly and affordable. They even give you free visits after going in so many times as well as for your birthday or referring people. These guys rule. As long as they are open and we are in QC I will be going to them.
Five,"I absolutely LOVE this place!  I've gone to several pilates studios over the years and swear by its ability to transform my body!  This place is comfy, easy to schedule, really friendly and after just a few short weeks, I see noticeable differences in my  waist, bust, arms and tummy.  I don't have much free time in my schedule, and these mat classes make it the best bang for my buck- just those hour classes a couple times a week, and I'm right on track for my fitness goals.  Even my husband goes to help his back.  Sonia is my favorite teacher, but I like them all- really nice, patient at explaining movements and always on time.  I highly recommend!"
Two,"If I am shopping at the Smart and Final next door and this store happens to be open (it opens 2 hours later than the Smart and Final and that is too long to hang out on a 110 degree day) then I will drop by to pick up some dollar goodies. Not as well laid out as the other dollar stores in this chain. It is very difficult to find someone to help you and it is not uncommon to find the check out registers unmanned. It is a great place to find $.50 greeting cards and $1 cleaning supplies, but I would steer clear of any of the medications made in China and trust me on this--the paint masking tape is totally useless!\nParking is easy, but the Broadway Rd entrances and exits can be very difficult to get in and out of during afternoon rush hour when the traffic backs up."
Five,"""Must. Find. . . Beer. Cold Beer. On a quest searching, searching, searching for a bubbly nector that must be in a container colder than the liquid itself. \What would you like?\"""" Fat Tire.  Within 3 minutes from my arrival, I drank two glasses with the same level of glee a child demonstrates when discovering and consuming the ice cream chunks on the bottom of a not so well blended milk shake. I consumed with the exact same enthusiasm a crack addicts has during his first dose right after falling from the bandwagon. It was as if I had never drank anything in my life. Everything stopped the moment I felt the bubbles pass from my mouth down my throat and into my empty stomach. It was a beautiful internal waterfall. I was in this desert for so long, and I found my waterfall.  I didn't need any food. I didn't need or want conversation. I left with exactly what I wanted. A cold beer in an even colder glass."""""""
Four,Ate the RnR burger there for lunch and it was one of the better burgers I've had. On the messy side but good. The bacon they use is good quality thick cut that isn't too greasy or salty. The meat is on the thick side so I ended up eating about 2/3rds of it. I got the half and half sweet potato/normal fries and they were ok. The only negative was that it took a while to get the food. \n\nIt seems like a bar hangout at night.
Five,"""Use is the best review; I am in Cartel around 5 times per week.\n\nThe coffee can't be beat. They roast their own beans in house (that's what the giant locomotive-looking thing in the corner is) and grind the beans immediately before preparing each hot coffee or espresso. They use the Clover coffee brewing machine, which brews each cup of coffee individually and automatically. Their iced coffee is a concoction called Toddy, which I like to call \crack\"""" because of its high caffeine content and extremely economical price. This is cold-brewed for 24 hours and is also delicious. So short of starting their own coffee plantation in their backyard, Cartel has the entire process - roasting to grinding to brewing - in-house, while most other coffeeshops only handle the grinding and brewing aspects. There is something to be said for freshly roast coffee, I just can't say it because my fingers are flying across the keyboard too fast.\n\nTheir selection of coffees is amazing. At S------s, I could never tell the difference between their coffee varieties, and was skeptical that any difference could actually exist in that kind of corporate environment. Cartel puts them to shame with the multiplicity of flavors found in one cup of Huehuetenango (Guatemalan), much less their Brazilian, Salvadorian, and (new) Ethiopian varieties. Best of all many are direct-trade and organic, meaning they come from a farmer that the owners of Cartel have personally met and made a deal with.\n\nThe atmosphere is fantastic as long as you can drop out of the speedy American mindset - and if you don't mind the more generic side of indie/pop rock. Come here for a date, a long computing session (free wifi), or to relive your European caf\u00e9 experience - the coffee might even be better."""""""
Four,"Did I like the place? Yes\nWas it the best gyro I've ever had? No\nWill I be back? Yes\n\nLike most other restaurants in the valley it's in another dying strip mall.  So there's not much to say about its presence from the street.  However, while inside you would think it was full of life and not dull at all.  \n\nThe gyros aren't bad, but the tzatziki sauce was amazing I have to admit.  Don't know what they did with that sauce, but that alone will keep me coming back.  I also like their salads they offer with fresh looking ingredients and great tasting house dressing.\n\nThe decor has a nice Greek theme with a Chicago influence, who would have thought?  The restaurant is pretty clean, but a little cluttered in some areas.  Not a big complaint at all, just wish they would put things where they should be and not in plain site of the customers.\n\nDefinitely worth a visit if in the area!"
Five,"Called for reservations, was notified they do not have reservations, just have call ahead up to one hour ahead.  Thought it would be an issue but there was nothing to it!!! The music was said to be loud but I didn't notice it being too loud at all.  There is line dancing by the employees in the middle of the restaurant too.  The best service I have received in a very long time.  Definitely worth my while being the last place I was going to eat before going back overseas to finish my tour of duty.  The meL was just the best ever. The ribs are all that they say they are. I look forward to coming back in a year when I get back to the states."
Three,"Kona Grill has two different atmospheres: Inside, it is a classy, yet casual, relaxing place to have great food. Outside on the patio or in the bar, it is a great place for socializing during their great happy hour. \n\nThe location is great, right in the mall. And their service is very good. I had their goat cheese pizza and it was marvelous. Their sushi, not so good, but decent when you're looking for $3 rolls for happy hour. \n\nI recommend Kona Grill if you're looking to socialize at their bar with friends, or looking to relax in a booth after a long day of shopping."
Four,"I was nervous the first time I went to eat at Tiny's.  My apprehension has to do with their location...in the past three years, the spot they are in has housed no less than five restaurants.  What if I like Tiny's and they can't overcome the curse of this location?!?  The good news for Tiny's is that they have changed the model, all the previous occupants were basically fast food hamburger type places.  Tiny's is a sit-down restaurant, only open for breakfast and lunch (and I believe they are closed SUN/MON).\n\nLast week, I popped in to try to get a to-go menu to try to convince the wife to give it a go.  Unfortunately, no to-go menus were available, so I just took a quick look at the menus.  Before I left, I chatted briefly with Tiny, who seemed nice.  This weekend, I had some family in town so we went there to try it out for breakfast.  \n\nNo problem finding a table, but the restaurant was about half filled the whole time I was there.  We were quickly offered drinks and I got some of coffee.  The good news is that the coffee is only $.99 for a bottomless cup!  The not so good news is that it kind of tastes like $.99, nothing too special about the coffee.  To compare to one of my go-to breakfast places in town (The Place aka Mike & Ronda's), I ordered a similar meal as to what I'd get there.  I ordered two scrambled eggs w/ cheese, hash browns and homemade biscuits.  My wife ordered one of the daily specials, Banana Nut Pancakes.  I have to say, when the food came out, I was a little underwhelmed, my biscuits were not huge like I expected and my wife's pancakes did not have any visible bananas or nuts.  Upon eating however, the flavors did not let me down.  I made some nice egg/cheese/potato biscuit sammies which were good.  Plus, the food got better as I ate, and I always like that.  My wife didn't finish her pancakes, so I gave them a try.  I was pleasantly surprised with how stuffed they were with bananas and nuts.  They were very good.\n\nI liked Tiny's, and even better, my wife did too.  I'm sure we will be back, though maybe next time for lunch to see how their chicken fried steak is.  Four stars for the good grub.  Hopefully they stick around."
Four,"Exactly what  my fat butt needs... another buffet.\n\nThe only reason we came here was because the Renaissance Hotel hooked me and wifey up with some breakfast vouchers. Not sure why we got them, but I wasn't going to ask questions. I had trouble sleeping that night, because I was so excited about running a train on some free grub in the morning. \n\nI woke wifey up at about 8:00 AM to get breakfast. I told her I was hungry, but I lied. I knew I probably could go till 9:00 AM, but she takes about 30 minutes to wake up and another 30 minutes to get ready. I figured by the time she's done, I will be legitimately hungry. \n\nThe restaurant itself, wasn't hard to find. Down the elevator and make a right when you hit the lobby. It was pretty busy, because of some convention going on. We waited about 5-10 minutes and got seated. The buffet normally runs 17/head and it comes with hot entrees, fresh fruit, juices, coffee, etc. \n\nI started off with some scrambled eggs, sausage, smoked bacon, seasoned breakfast potatoes, and some citrus pancakes w/ agave butter. Delicious. The sausage was perfectly cooked; crisp casing with a juicy pork meat. The bacon had a crunch, but it wasn't overdone. The thing that really left a good impression was the citrus pancakes. It was crispy, but moist. A hint of orange, but not too overwhelming. The warm butter and agave butter make all the flavors marry together. I ate 4 pancakes. \n\nfor round two, I loaded up on fresh berries, a couple pastries, and some banana nut bread. Nothing out of the ordinary, but pretty good as well. They also had some fancy cheeses too. Not your typical American and Provolone Cheese, but actual mushroom brie, camembert, etc. It would have went well with the Lox, but they ran out. \n\nfor round three, I ate 4 more pancakes. (they were small, don't judge)\n\nOverall, the dining experience was pleasant. Wifey enjoyed her meal with some Starbucks coffee. I went with the freshly squeezed Orange Juice. I wanted to try their fresh squeeze fuji apple juice, but it was hard to pin down the server with every table in the restaurant full. Maybe next time.\n\nA little about my credentials:\nI first got into cooking & food when I was in college. After being rejected by numerous girls and getting zero action, I decided it was time for a change. I needed a new makeover to boost my geeky image. I applied for a cooking position at a Mediterranean-Italian Restaurant near my home and learned to cook all sorts of pastas and dishes. I never became a professional chef, but 9 years later and 55 lbs heavier, I continue to enjoy & love food."
Five,"These guys definitely get a recommendation from me.  The nozzle under a bathroom sink broke and water was going everywhere.  I'm covering the leak with one hand and typing emergency plumber into yelp on my phone.  I clicked on these guys because they were the first one's I came across that said they were open (it was 8pm).  Aaron promptly answered the phone, got my address and said he'd be there shortly.  30 minutes later they were at the door.\n\nNot only did they quickly replace the broken nozzle, but they also diagnosed and fixed a hot water problem I was having with a couple of showers not heating up.  In and out in about 30 minutes.  1 hour earlier I thought my night was ruined.  An hour later thanks to Paramount we're back on track.\n\nAnother thing I should mention.  In my haste to get the problem fixed I didn't bother to ask Aaron what their rates were.  He could have really taken it to me when I asked what I owed.  But his rates were VERY fair.  I appreciated that they didn't try to take advantage with some outrageous after hours charges.  If/when I have other plumbing problems I will surely be using Paramount."
Five,"I'm not one for hyperbole, but this may have been\n\nTHE  BEST      MEAL      OF   MY       LIFE!!!!\n\nI'd like to hold an awards show and give out lifetime achievement trophies to the following individuals:\n\n1.  To the chef, who exceeded my expectations again and again. The Stetson salad, wild boar meatballs, and Korean-style BBQ short ribs (and that killer side of au-gratin brussel sprouts) and you, sir, have won my heart and my stomach.  I want to fill a swimming pool with that BBQ sauce!\n\n2.  To our server, Richard.  Your genuine excitement for the food was a nice change from past servers reluctant to give a real recommendation.  You were cordial and professional and made sure we enjoyed our time with you.  I don't know, I may name my unborn child after you in tribute.\n\n3.  To the pastry chef, Country.  Your bread pudding was exceptional, but what a surprise, your ice creams were downright dreamy!  The scoop of brown butter ice cream took my tastebuds on a field trip through chilled fields of chocolate truffles.\n\nThank you thank you for a wonderful birthday dinner!"
